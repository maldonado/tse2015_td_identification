WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a convenience method that several other methods might call.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this entry already exists. so go with the first one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a method that does the work on a given entry in a mergefile. the big deal is to set the right parameters in the zipentry on the output stream.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure that we've got a srcdir
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the compiler does its own dependency stuff we just call it right now
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the remainder of this method is only for compilers that need their dependency work done
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	scan source directories and dest directory to build up both copy lists and compile lists
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	string srcfiledir=srcfile.getparent()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end inner class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since we don't mangle extensions like the servlet does we need to check for keywords as class names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first char is more restrictive than the rest
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the rest
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the first char is not a start of java identifier or is _ prepend a '_'.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are forking here to be sure that if jspc calls system.exit() it doesn't halt the build

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure the test annotation are accepted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will cause trouble in jdk 1.1 if omitted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	local copy since logoutputstream.task is private
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this one is here because the changes to support resourcecollections have broken magic's junittesttask. the task adds a fileset to a batchtest instance using the java api and without telling the fileset about its project instance. the original code would pass in project on the call to getdirectoryscanner - which is now hidden deep into resources.iterator() and not reachable.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for jdk 5 first. will not help on jdk 1.4 if only junit-4.0.jar in cp because in that case linkage of whole task will already have failed! but will help if cp has junit-3.8.2.jarjunit-4.0.jar.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in that case first c.fn will fail with cnfe and we will avoid unsupportedclassversionerror.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ok fall back to junit 3.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	interestingly enough we get to here when a user uses -dname=value. however in some cases the os goes ahead and parses this out to args {"-dname" "value"} so instead of parsing on "=" we just make the "-d" characters go away and skip one argument forward. i don't know how to predict when the jdk is going to help or not so we simply look for the equals sign.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore - we are interested only in the side effect - that of getting the static initializers invoked. as we do not want to call a valid constructor to get this side effect an attempt is made to call a hopefully invalid constructor - come on nobody would have a constructor that takes in 256 string arguments -) (in fact they can't - according to jvm spec section 4.10 the number of method parameters is limited to 255 by the definition of a method descriptor. constructors count as methods here.)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	also check for properly formed uris. ant formerly recommended using nonsense uris such as "file./foo.xml" in xml includes. you shouldn't do that (just "foo.xml" is correct) but for compatibility we special-case things when the path is not absolute and fall back to the old parsing behavior.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the file being added is meta-inf/application.xml we warn if it's not the one specified in the "appxml" attribute - or if it's being added twice meaning the same file is specified by the "appxml" attribute and in a <fileset> element.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collect filesets to pass them to getresourcestoadd
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we're in this finally clause because of an exception we don't really care if there's an exception when closing the stream. e.g. if it throws "zip file must have at least one entry" because an exception happened before we added any files then we must swallow this exception. otherwise the error that's reported will be the close() error which is not the real cause of the problem.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	bad luck. there are resources in the filesets that make the archive out of date but not in the non-fileset resources. we need to rescan the non-filesets to grab all of them now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	zips store time with a granularity of 2 seconds round up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	zipoutputstream.putnextentry expects the zipentry to know its size and the crc sum before you start writing the data when using stored mode - unless it is seekable. this forces us to process the data twice.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	precedence manifestfile wins over inline manifest over manifests read from the filesets over the original manifest. merge with null argument is a no-op
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	filesets are separate from the rest for performance reasons. if we use the code for union below we'll always scan all filesets even if we know the target is out of date after the first test.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the archive is built for the first time and it is matched by a resource collection then it hasn't been found in check (it hasn't been there) but will be included now. for some strange reason the old code would simply skip the entry and not fail do the same now for backwards compatibility reasons. without this the which4j build fails in gump
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	preserve permissions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	override permissions if set explicitly
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check if we can contact the url
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the exec os check is different from os.isos() which probes for a specific os. instead it searches the os field for the current os.name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	similar to a fileset but doesn't allow dir attribute to be set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the destination directory didn't already exist or was empty then no previous file removal is necessary!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default the viewpath to basedir if it is not specified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	preserveintarget would find all files we want to keep but we need to find all that we want to delete - so the meaning of all patterns and selectors must be inverted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	on vms platform we need to create a special java options file containing the arguments and classpath for the java command. the special file is supported by the "-v" switch on the vms jvm.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing if no resources (including nested text)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	windows has a 32k limit on total arg size so create a temporary file to store all the arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	filesets has been protected so we need to keep that even after switching to resource collections. in fact they will still get a different treatment form the other resource collections even in execute since we have some subtle special features like switching type to "dir" when we encounter a dirset that would be more difficult to achieve otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to reset the stream handler to restart reading of pipes go ahead and do it always w/ nested redirectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here in and out have not been specified we are in batch processing mode.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point there is one trailing space to remove if the list is not empty.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	locate the auxiliary script

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	writes the command into a temporary dcl script and returns the corresponding file object. the script will be deleted on exit. @param cmd the command line to execute as an array of strings. @param env the environment to set as an array of strings. @return the command file. @throws ioexception if errors are encountered creating the file.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected and private methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ensure that parent dir of dest file exists!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the single group arguments javadoc 1.2 rules multiple -group args allowed. each arg includes 3 strings -group [name] [packagelist]. elements in [packagelist] are colon-delimited. an element in [packagelist] may end with the wildcard.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for each sourcepath entry add a directoryset with includes taken from packagenames attribute and nested package elements and excludes taken from excludepackages attribute and nested excludepackage elements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	override the logging of output in order to filter out generating messages. generating messages are set to a priority of verbose unless they appear after what could be an informational message.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if verbosity is msg_verbose that mean we are doing regular logging (backwards as that sounds). in that case we want to print one message about deleting the top of the directory tree. otherwise the removedir method will handle messages for _all_ directories.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hand down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create intermediary directories - sometimes zip don't add them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sql defines "--" as a comment to eol and in oracle it may contain a hint so we cannot just remove it instead we must end it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in ant 1.1 <chmod dir="foo" /> means change the permissions of directory foo not anything inside of it. this is the case the second branch of the if statement below catches for backwards compatibility.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for historical and performance reasons we have to do things in a rather complex way. (1) move is optimized to move directories if a fileset has been included completely therefore filesets need a special treatment. this is also required to support the failonerror semantice (skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collections). (2) we carry around a few protected methods that work on basedirs and arrays of names. to optimize stuff all resources with the same basedir get collected in separate lists and then each list is handled in one go.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we create a fileset with the source file. this lets us combine our logic for handling output directories mapping etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if input files are specified inputstring and inputstream are ignored classes that work with redirector attributes can enforce whatever warnings are needed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore exception

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for -sourcepath use the "sourcepath" value if present. otherwise default to the "srcdir" value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	many system have been reported to get into trouble with long command lines - no not only windows -). posix seems to define a lower limit of 4k so use a temporary file if the total length of the command line exceeds this limit.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is a bootclasspath stated. by default the includejavaruntime is false. if the user has stated a bootclasspath and said to include the java runtime it's on their head!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following is data used while processing stdout of cvs command

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check the timestamp on the ejb implementation class. note that if only the implementation class has changed it's not necessary to rebuild the ejb stubs and skeletons. for this reason we ensure the file exists (using lastmodified above) but we don't compare it's timestamp with the timestamps of the home and remote interfaces (because it's irrelevant in determining if ejbc must be run)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here it could be because we are trying to put a directory entry that already exists. for example we're trying to write "com" but a previous entry from another mergefile was called "com". in that case just ignore the error and go on to the next entry.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first some notes. on mrj 2.2.2 getting the size compressed size and crc32 from the zipinputstream does not work for compressed (deflated) files. those calls return -1. for uncompressed (stored) files those calls do work. however using zipfile.getentries() works for both compressed and uncompressed files. now from some simple testing i did it seems that the value of crc-32 is independent of the compression setting. so it should be easy to pass this information on to the output entry.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	quick return - no output do nothing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	self-describing as of junit 4 (#38811). but trim "(classname)".
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the trick to integrating test output to the formatter is to create a special test class that asserts an error and tell the formatter that it raised.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignored.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	pre ant 1.6 this method used to call getclass().getresource while ant 1.6 will call classloader.getresource(). the difference is that class.getresource expects a leading slash for "absolute" resources and will strip it before delegating to classloader.getresource - so we now have to emulate class's behavior.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	okay we have a copy of the child now the child becomes the parent and we are iterating recursively over its children.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	because of the way i create the full target path there must be no slash at the end of targetfolder and foldername however if the slash or backslash is the only character leave it alone
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	connect to the starteam server and log on.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	simplest constructor uses default encryption algorithm and compression level.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create a variable dir that contains the name of the starteam folder that is the root folder in this view. get the default path to the current view.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to display the folder the same way you would enter it on the command line so we remove the view name (which is also the name of the root folder and therefore shows up at the start of the path).

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have the loader which is being used to load the catalogresolver. can it see the apacheresolver? the base resolver will only be able to create the apacheresolver if it can see it - doesn't use the context loader.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the passed in base in preference to the base from matchingentry which is either null or the directory in which the external catalog file from which it was obtained is located. we make a copy so matchingentry's original base is untouched. this is the standard behavior as per my reading of the jaxp and xml catalog specs. cks 11/7/2002
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get method instances for each of the methods we need to call on the resolverimpl using reflection. we can't call them directly because they require on the xml-commons resolver library which may not be available in the classpath.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we didn't match a resourcelocation but since we only support public and uri entry types internally it is still possible that there is another entry in an external catalog that will match. we call apache resolver's resolveentity method to cover this possibility.

DESIGN	xxx what is this for?
DESIGN	what is the property supposed to be?
DESIGN	provide public visibility
DESIGN	"" should become a single empty argument same for '' pr 5906
DESIGN	sorry - otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader
DESIGN	should move to a separate public class - and have api to add listeners etc.
DESIGN	-------------------- access to property tables -------------------- this is used to support ant call and similar tasks. it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better (more efficient) mechanism to preserve the context.
DESIGN	report error if something weird happensthis is diagnostic.
DESIGN	don't call super.close() because that reader is used on other places
DESIGN	xxx ignore attributes in a different ns ( maybe store them ? )
DESIGN	xxx move to project ( so it is shared by all helpers )
DESIGN	pr hack for ant-type value an ant-type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri/name
DESIGN	not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions.
DESIGN	we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up. do we need to do this? lh
DESIGN	we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error/warning xxx is this correct?
DESIGN	@todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it. this should probably be modified to use the classname instead.
DESIGN	mac os 9 and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
DESIGN	xxx what is the following doing? should it run if !javadoc4 && executable != null?
DESIGN	xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement (other patterns ?)
DESIGN	xxx we should use jcvs (www.ice.com/jcvs) instead of command line execution so that we don't rely on having native cvs stuff around (sm)
DESIGN	xxx perhaps we shouldn't use properties for these three options (emacs mode warnings and pedantic) but include it in the javac directive?
DESIGN	not sure what could be the need of this
DESIGN	if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it. should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this so that in case of errors we don't leave people worse off than when we started =)
DESIGN	cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility >(
DESIGN	xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky! careful.. similar code in scandir but slightly different!!
DESIGN	todo parameterise ?? call compiler as class dont want to fork again use classic compiler -- can be parameterised?
DESIGN	there's a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
DESIGN	probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in classpath
DESIGN	quick & dirty to make nested mapped p-sets work
DESIGN	i can't get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here?
DESIGN	xxx unfortunately jdk1.2 adds entryset() keyset() values() - implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later.
DESIGN	since java 1.4 return normalizedpath.split("/") workaround for java 1.2-1.3
DESIGN	xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation?
DESIGN	singleton for now it may change ( per/classloader )
DESIGN	hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class' static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor.
DESIGN	xxx - shouldn't this always return false in isolated mode?
DESIGN	xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container.touri().tourl() and the same permissioncollection as project.class.protectiondomain had
DESIGN	quick fix for ant.java use of property before initializing the project
DESIGN	pr i do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only
DESIGN	there is a better way to save the context. this shouldn't delegate to next it's for backward compatibility only.
DESIGN	stolen from org.apache.xerces.impl.xmlentitymanager#getuserdir() of the xerces-j team which ascii characters need to be escaped
DESIGN	this is faintly ridiculous
DESIGN	xxx - failed to load the class properly. should we print a warning here?
DESIGN	the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
DESIGN	super.validateattributes() don't want to call this method
DESIGN	this is the new better way - use classespath instead of sourcespath. the code is currently the same - you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files.
DESIGN	this is the old way and is deprecated - classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	this is deprecated - use classespath in the future
DESIGN	xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky!
DESIGN	junit 4 wraps solo tests this way. we can extract the original test name with a little hack.
DESIGN	bingo append it. (this should normally not be done here)
DESIGN	xxx is this code still necessary? is there any 1.2+ port? pull in .zip from packages directory
DESIGN	this array really shouldn't be here. again for historical purposes it is. <p>fixme this array should be in a private or package private location since it could be modified by malicious code.</p>
DESIGN	xxx - should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	experimental/testing will be removed
DESIGN	temporary - until we figure a better api
DESIGN	todo not read yet in a public setter

DESIGN	xxx could perhaps also call thread.stop() not sure if anyone cares
DESIGN	todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter.
DESIGN	xxx - we are committing combiningchar and extender here
DESIGN	we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
DESIGN	xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials.. gotta remove.
DESIGN	fix for invalid characters. if you think of more add to the list.
DESIGN	this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
DESIGN	xxx - why not simply new file(dir filename)?
DESIGN	this is ugly checking for the root folder.
DESIGN	check it out also ugly.
DESIGN	why do we do nothing?
DESIGN	silly hack to avoid stack overflow
DESIGN	only the developer knows what (s)he is doing

DESIGN	xxx - should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	xxx - should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	xxx (jon skeet) any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers (as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure)?
DESIGN	for script example that modifies id'ed tasks in other targets to work. very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable
DESIGN	two reasons are mentioned in the api docs for file.list (1) dir is not a directory. this is impossible as we wouldn't get here in this case. (2) an io error occurred (why doesn't it throw an exception then???)
DESIGN	xxx i really don't like this - the xml processor is still too 'involved' in the processing. a better solution (imo) would be to create ue for project and target too and then process the tree and have project/target deal with its attributes ( similar with description ). if we eventually switch to ( or add support for ) dom things will work smoothly - ue can be avoided almost completely ( it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility )
DESIGN	jakarta commons logging listener. note do not use the simplelog as your logger implementation as it causes an infinite loop since it writes to system.err which ant traps and reroutes to the logger/listener layer. the following names are used for the log org.apache.tools.ant.project.project_name - for project events org.apache.tools.ant.target.target_name - for target events task_class_name.target_name - for events in individual targets. in all target and project names we replace "." and " " with "-". todo we should use the advanced context logging features (and expose them in c-l first -) todo this is _very_ inefficient. switching the out and tracking the logs can be optimized a lot - but may require few more changes to the core. @since ant 1.5
DESIGN	this is a rather hairy case. one of our subclasses knows that we need to update the archive but at the same time there are no resources known to us that would need to be added. only the subclass seems to know what's going on. this happens if <jar> detects that the manifest has changed for example. the manifest is not part of any resources because of our support for inline <manifest>s. if we invoke createemptyzip like ant 1.5.2 did we'll loose all stuff that has been in the original archive (bugzilla report 17780).
DESIGN	these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us.
DESIGN	set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a target is out of date. todo this is not yet used. @param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of date.
DESIGN	fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or don't know how to handle it (there is no easy way to know what idl mode would generate. this is supposed to make ant always recompile the class as a file of that name should not exist.
DESIGN	todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc. you have to provide the rules in the constructors - no setters available.
DESIGN	xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation?
DESIGN	hammer end inline maingtu
DESIGN	we have to deal with assembly!!! the programmer can be writing little 32 byte chunks for all we know and we must assemble complete records for writing. review maybe this should be in tarbuffer? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying.
