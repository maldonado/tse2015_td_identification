WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the upper half bitmask for all ascii characters between the two given characters inclusive.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the lower half bitmask for all the ascii characters in the given string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns whether the given character is in the set specified by the given bitmask.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	converts null to length-zero array and clones array to ensure immutability.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checks whether the string contains any more segments after the one that starts at position i.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	validates all of the uri components. factory methods should call this before using the constructor though they must ensure that the inter-component requirements described in their own javadocs are all satisfied themselves. if a new uri is being constructed out of an existing uri this need not be called. instead just the new components may be validated individually.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	alternate stricter implementations of the following validation methods are provided commented out for possible future use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid scheme may be null or consist of a single letter followed by any number of letters numbers and the following characters <code>+ - .</code>
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid opaque part must be non-null and non-empty. it may contain any allowed uri characters but its first character may not be <code>/</code>
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return value != null && value.length() != 0 && value.charat(0) != segment_separator && validate(value uric_hi uric_lo true true)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a valid authority may be null or contain any allowed uri characters except for the following <code>/ ?</code>
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid path segment must be non-null and may contain any allowed uri characters except for the following <code>/ ?</code>
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns null if the specified value is null or would be a valid path segment array of a uri otherwise the value of the first invalid segment.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	searches the specified string for any characters in the set represented by the 128-bit bitmask. returns true if any occur or false otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note (absolutepath || authority == null) -> hierarchical (authority == null && device == null && !absolutepath) -> scheme == null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note authority == null -> hierarchical (authority == null && device == null && !absolutepath) -> scheme == null

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note authority == null -> hierarchical (authority == null && device == null && !absolutepath) -> scheme == null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns true if the given value is an archive scheme as defined by the org.eclipse.emf.common.util.uri.archiveschemes system property. by default "jar" "zip" and "archive" are considered archives.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests whether this uri's path segment array is equal to that of the given uri.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests two objects for equality tolerating nulls null is considered to be a valid value that is only equal to itself.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests two strings for equality tolerating nulls and optionally ignoring case.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note it's okay for two uris to share a segments array since neither will ever modify it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	relative path merge with base and keep query (note if the base has no path and this a non-empty relative path there is an implied root in the resulting path)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always keep fragment even if null and use scheme from base no validation needed since all components are from existing uris
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a stack to accumulate segments of base except for the last (i.e. skip trailing separator and anything following it) and of relative path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	adds a segment to a stack skipping empty segments and self references and interpreting parent references.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special care must be taken for a root's parent reference it is either ignored or the symbolic reference itself is pushed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unless we're already accumulating root parent references parent references simply pop the last segment descended
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note these assertions imply that neither this nor the base uri has a relative path thus both have either an absolute path or no path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the shortest relative path between the the non-relative path of the given base and this absolute path. if the base has no path it is treated as the root absolute path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note that the copied tree should not be modified by wrapped astjfield the copied tree will have source ranges for all nodes in the source file hence the get methods in the new astjfield will not return the right contents
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a single separator possibly preceded by some parent reference segments is redundant
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an empty path needs to be replaced by a single "." if there is no query to distinguish it from a current document reference
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collapses non-ending empty segments parent references and self references in a non-relative path returning the same path that would be produced from the base hierarchical uri as part of a resolve.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the path is non-empty and originally ended in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns a string representation of this uri for debugging explicitly showing each of the components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the new prefix has segments it is not the root absolute path and we need to drop the trailing empty segment and append the tail segments.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this is a hierarchical uri reference and prefix is a prefix of it returns the portion of the path remaining after that prefix has been trimmed null otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don't even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this must have no fewer segments than the prefix. since the prefix is not the root absolute path its last segment is empty all others must match.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create new field and replace it all by original contents
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the prefix really is a prefix of this. if this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	encodes a complete uri optionally leaving % characters unescaped when beginning a valid three-character escape sequence. we can either treat the first or # as a fragment separator or encode them all.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	range to look for comments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	encodes the given string replacing each ascii character that is not in the set specified by the 128-bit bitmask and each non-ascii character below 0xa0 by an escape sequence of % followed by two hex digits. if % is not in the set but ignoreescaped is true then % will not be encoded iff it already begins a valid escape sequence.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests whether an escape occurs in the given string starting at index i. an escape sequence is a % followed by two hex digits.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find start position of farthest preceding comment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the byte is automatically widened into an int with sign extension for shifting. this can introduce 1's to the left of the byte which must be cleared by masking before looking up the hex digit.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the character encoded by % followed by the two given hex digits which is always 0xff or less so can safely be casted to a byte. if either character is not a hex digit a bogus result will be returned.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	determine the base url by looking for the plugin.properties file in the standard way.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add leading hanging comments to the previous node hence only comments immediately preceding the node will be in the range for removal
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for enum constants use special range
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	simpler implementation that sets the range of any node to be the node and all preceding comments public sourcerange computesourcerange(astnode node) { sourcerange range = new sourcerange(node.getstartposition() node.getlength()) range = extendrangebackward(findleadingcomment(node getpreviousnode(node) false) range) return range }

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for an archive uri check for the plugin.properties in the archive.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	append extra dimensions since they are not stored in type object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	trim off the "bin" or "runtime" segment.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the plugin.properties isn't within the root of the archive create a new uri for the folder location of the archive so we can look in the folder that contains it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we didn't find the plugin.properties in the usual place nor in the archive
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we can open an input stream then the plugin.properties is in the folder and we have a good base url.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we still don't have a good base url complain about it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don't create an iterator stack until the root mapping itself has been returned by next once. after that the stack should be non-empty and the top iterator should yield true for hasnext.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we are still on the root mapping itself
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	yield that mapping create a stack record it as the next one to prune and add it to the stack.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the top iterator retrieve it's result and record it as the one to which remove will be delegated.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the result about to be returned has children
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	record the iterator as the next one to prune and add it to the stack.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there will be no iterator to prune.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	while the current iterator has no next
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	pop it from the stack.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the stack is empty we're done.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the given class is subclass of enum and node is of subclass of type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	pop it off the stack.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the next one down and then test it for has next.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there is an iterator to prune.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	you can only prune once.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the lower-cased schemes that will be used to identify archive uris.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special segment values interpreted at resolve and resolve time.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some character classes as defined in rfc 2396's bnf for uri. these are 128-bit bitmasks stored as two longs where the nth bit is set iff the ascii character with value n is included in the set. these are created with the highbitmask() and lowbitmask() methods defined below and a character is tested against them using matches().
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	| ucschar | escaped
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we can't want to do encoding of platform resource uris by default yet.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the upper half bitmask for all the ascii characters in the given string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	uses a cache to speed up creation of a uri from a string. the cache is consulted to see if the uri less any fragment has already been created. if needed the fragment is re-appended to the cached uri which is considerably more efficient than creating the whole uri from scratch. if the uri wasn't found in the cache it is created using parseintouri() and then cached. this method should always be used by string-parsing factory methods instead of parseintouri() directly.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finds the next occurrence of one of the characters in the set represented by the given bitmask in the given string beginning at index i. the index of the first found character or s.length() if there is none is returned. before searching i is limited to the range [0 s.length()].
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	boolean iri = false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	iri = iri || containsnonascii(segments[i])
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid query may be null or contain any allowed uri characters.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return value == null || validate(value uric_hi uric_lo true true)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests the non-null string value to see if it contains only ascii characters in the set represented by the specified 128-bit bitmask as well as optionally non-ascii characters 0xa0 and above and also optionally escape sequences of % followed by two hex digits. this method is used for the new strict uri validation that is not not currently in place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note authority == null -> hierarchical (authority == null && device == null && !absolutepath) -> scheme == null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	current document reference use base path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else keep device path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else keep authority device path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	merges this uri's relative path with the base non-relative path. if base has no path treat it as the root absolute path unless this has no path either.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the relative path is empty or ends in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator to a non-empty path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since base must be hierarchical and since a non-hierarchical uri must have both scheme and opaque part the complete absolute uri is needed to resolve to a non-hierarchical uri
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	path form demands an absolute path keep it and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always include fragment even if null no validation needed since all components are from existing uris
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns true if the non-relative path includes segments that would be collapsed when resolving false otherwise. if preserverootparents is true collapsible segments include any empty segments except for the last segment as well as and parent and self references. if preserverootsparents is false parent references are not collapsible if they are the first segment or preceded only by other parent references.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if endpath is shorter than startpath the last segment of endpath may not be compared because startpath has been collapsed and had its last segment removed all preceding segments can be considered non- empty and followed by a separator while the last segment of endpath will either be non-empty and not followed by a separator or just empty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	absolute path or no path -> absolute path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	computes a three-character escape sequence for the byte appending it to the stringbuffer. only characters up to 0xff should be escaped all but the least significant byte will be ignored.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns <code>true</code> if this uri contains non-ascii characters <code>false</code> otherwise. this unused code is included for possible future use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if that fails determine the url for the class itself. the url will be of one of the following forms so there are a few good places to consider looking for the plugin.properties. for a plugin.xml with runtime="common.jar" jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="runtime/common.jar" jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/runtime/common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="." where the plugin is jarred jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="." where the plugin is not jarred. file/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/org/eclipse/emf/common/commonplugin.class running in pde with bin on classpath file/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/bin/org/eclipse/emf/common/commonplugin.class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we can open an input stream then the plugin.properties is there and we have a good base url.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the bundle can't be found the normal way try to find it as the base url. if that also doesn't work rethrow the original exception.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not want to diagnose any errors that have already been diagnosed by a super type. although we ignore all the first super's features there may be mixin classes that still would result in duplicates.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is no match if the types are different and they don't each specify the same non-null instance class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is built-in and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resolve relative uri to base uri - see rfc 2396 section 5.2 in some cases it might make more sense to throw an exception (when scheme is specified is the string spec and the base uri is also specified for example) but we're just following the rfc specifications
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if this is the current doc - rfc 2396 5.2 #2 note that this is slightly different from the rfc spec in that we don't include the check for query string being null - this handles cases where the urispec is just a query string or a fragment (e.g. "?y" or "#s") - see <httpwww.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/url/test1.html> which identified this as a bug in the rfc

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the feature is a bidirectional reference with a multiplicity-many reverse a composite reverse or a multiplicity-1 reverse that is already set (on value) then we'll switch things around and execute this command a little differently because otherwise it's not undoable.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we never directly set a multiplicity-many feature to a list directly. instead we remove the old values values move the values that remain and insert the new values. if all old values are removed we'll still set it to an empty list or unset it as appropriate.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remember the static instance.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize package
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see if we already have the edatatype.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just to be helpful we'll recognize a type of org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.featuremap and convert it to efeaturemapentry. this way a datatype need not be specified. but we won't do this if recorddemandcreateedatatype is false so we don't change the instanceclass of a new edatatype that's implicitly being defined for featuremap.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we don't have one yet maybe it's one of the special types
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we still don't have one we'll have to settle for a demand created edatatype or eclass so create a new eclassifier with a nice unique name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the name isn't qualified it might be a primitive or from java.lang. otherwise assume it's in the current package and use the nsprefix for the qualified package name.
