IMPLEMENTATION	todo the copy function is not yet completely implemented - so we will have some exceptions here and there.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo a better implementation would be to batch events into logical groups and update the tree one time for the entire group synchronizing access to the model repository so that it stays consistent during the query. this would likely require doing the updates in a different thread than the event delivery thread to prevent deadlocks so for right now we protect ourselves with try/catch blocks.

IMPLEMENTATION	now we know that this critic is still valid. what we need to figure out is if the corresponding to-do item is still valid. the to-do item is to be replaced if the name of some offender has changed that affects its description or if the contents of the list of offenders has changed. we check that by creating a new todoitem and then verifying that it looks exactly the same. this really creates a lot of to-do items that goes to waste.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not implemented yet. the idea is that some problems identified by critic's can be fixed with certain design manipulations (or transforms) that can be applied automatically to resolve the problem. this method replies true iff the given problem can be fixed. the fixit() method actually does the fix. @see org.argouml.cognitive.poster#canfixit(org.argouml.cognitive.todoitem) also @see critic#fixit

IMPLEMENTATION	get the innermost containing model of a modelelement. <p> if no containing model can be found the outermost containing modelelement is returned (which could be the original element itself if it has no owner). <p> this method is intended to return the innermost containing model but there are circumstances where one may really expect the outermost containing model or root package to be returned (e.g. where it's being used to test if two elements are from disjoint namespace hierarchies). hence there are two separate methods with different semantics. the method {@link #getroot(object)} returns the outermost containing object. <p> todo note also that some code uses org.argouml.kernel.project#getroot() to navigate down from the top instead of up from the bottom. we need to use a consistent algorithm for this. - tfm 20070724 @param handle to the model element. @return model for the model element.

IMPLEMENTATION	the drag gesture listener is notified of drag gestures by a recognizer. the typical response is to initiate a drag by invoking dragsource.startdrag(). <p> todo find a way to show a different image when multiple elements are dragged. @param draggestureevent the draggestureevent describing the gesture that has just occurred @see java.awt.dnd.draggesturelistener#draggesturerecognized(java.awt.dnd.draggestureevent)
IMPLEMENTATION	the list with objects that should be shown in the combobox. todo using a list here forces a linear search when we're trying to add a new element to the model which can be very slow for large models.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better to defer this initialization until the panel actually needs to be displayed. perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later if we've got something to display - tfm - 20070110
IMPLEMENTATION	finds the operation to which a callevent refers based on the given transition. this function determines the context of the statemachine that contains the given transition. if the context is a classifier then all operations of this classifier are candidates. if the context is a behavioralfeature then all operations of the owner classifier are candidates. the first operation of which the name matches is the result. for activity diagrams if the context is a package then all operations of all classifiers in the package are candidates. todo this function works for the most normal cases but needs some testing for rare cases e.g. internal transitions todo the parameters of the candidates are ignored. maybe this method should return a set of matching operations. @author mvw @param trans object of type transition @param opname the name of the operation sought @return object the operation with the given name or null

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is a bug in the version of mdr (20050711) that we use that causes it to fail to delete aggregate elements which are single valued and where the aggregate end is listed second in the association defined in the metamodel. for the uml 1.4 metamodel this affects a statemachine's top statevertex and a transition's guard. see issue 4948 & 5227 - tfm 20080713
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in uml 1.3 the name is the only place to store text. in uml 1.4 there is a body as well but some tools still seem to use name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	although not represented in the ocl (or our java) the english text of wfr #4 of section 2.10.3.4 in the uml 1.4 spec is more restrictive - "[4] a collaboration may only contain classifierroles and associationroles the generalizations and the constraints between them and actions used in the collaboration's interactions."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following from the original nsuml implemenetation was attempting to implement wfr #1 from section 2.5.3.32 of the uml 1.4 spec but if there is an owner set no namespace is valid. the checks for this wfr if desired need to go in setowner() and settype() - tfm

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this comment was included in a previous version (before 1/2005) of the test which had this assertion commented out ------ interaction should not be removed when removing classifierrole maybe if the last message is removed from the interaction but even then it's doubtfull since it will probably lead to backward compatibility problems in save formats. ------ but my reading of the uml 1.4 specification is that an interaction without at least one message is definitely illegal so mdr is doing the right thing by removing it in this case where we only have a single message which then gets deleted. - tfm
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get a list of uml metaclass names from the xmi document. <p> though some of the dom methods such as getattributes may return null values under other conditions in the context of this test and assuming a valid xmi file none should occur. <p> hence there is no special checking for those abnormal cases allowing the test to fail simply with a nullpointerexception with this comment indicating that either the input data is incorrect or the test needs to be improved.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test creating modelelements from a given notation and then re-generate the notation-string again and check if they are equal. some of these tests are not very usefulll since they may fail on white space differences. todo white space should best be ignored.

IMPLEMENTATION	move any i18n files that are located in the core downloads dir to the i18n downloads dir. the spring application context will not load properly (for some unknown reason) when there are i18n jars in the classpath. so as a work-around we simply ensure that they are where they should be anyway. previously we were not as careful about this so it is possible that i18n jars were copied into the core downloads directory.

IMPLEMENTATION	todo if the use checks "export entire table" and doesn't select all then the selected indices are not set and this check doesn't properly detect missing data. if export entire table is selected we need to set the selected indexes below correctly.
IMPLEMENTATION	we just copied the last table. now it is safe to copy the constraints.(well that is if all fk dependencies are met in the group of tables being copied. todo new feature could be to examine table list for fk's in tables not in the list then prompt the user to add those missing tables to the list.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe someday we could inform the user that the imported key can't be created because the list of tables they've selected doesn't include the table that this foreign key depends upon. for now just log a warning and skip it.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if file name default and cmd is null or empty make sure this entry is not being held in cellimportexportinfosaver
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save the user options - we know that it is not the default because we do not allow importing from "temp file"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	user has not entered anything or has reset to defaults so make sure there is no entry for this column in the saved info
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the real name for use later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now that we have the file do the import. note the sequence of operations is divided into two sections at this point. the preceeding code ensures that we have a readable file and the code in the following method call does the import. the reason for splitting at this point is that the execute operation needs to do an import and it will already have the file to do the import from (which is the same as the file it exported into).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	file name verification operations are the same for both export and execute so do that work here for both. if file name is null or empty do not proceed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the file to open

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have done everything we can prior to this point to ensure that the the file is accessible but it is still possible that an existing file was removed at a bad moment. also the compiler insists that we put this in a try statement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	file exists is normal and is writable so see if user wants to overwrite contents of file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	user is ok with overwriting file we do not need to do anything special to overwrite (as opposed to appending) since the outputstring starts at the beginning of the file by default.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we could tell user here that export was canceled but i don't think its necessary and that avoids forcing user to do yet another annoying mouse click.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here then everything worked correctly so tell user that data was put into file. this is different from the import strategy because the user may not know the name of the file that was used if they selected the automatic temp file operation or they may not know what directory the file was actually put into so this tells them the full file path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this may be called either when the table is editable or when it is read-only. when it is read-only there is no command to be saved but when it is editable there may be a command.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if user did anything other than default then save their options

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for possibly bad return from child
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the dataobject returns a string to put into the popup which can later be converted to the appropriate object type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	command returned non-standard value. ask user before proceeding.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end of combined export and execute operations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the file was a temp file delete it now. we assume that export-only operations want to leave the file in place but execute operations just want a temp space to work with and do not want it lying around afterwards.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is handy to have the cannonical path name to show user in error messages. since getting that name might involve an ioexception we need to put it inside a try statement. however since the file does exist there is no good reason for getting an ioexception at this point but if we get one there is something seriously wrong and we want to abort. therefore it make sense to get that name here and save it for later use.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the imput stream (so that datatype objects don't have to)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hand file input stream to datatype object for import also handle file io errors here so that datatype objects do not have to.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no need for conversion

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datatypes may limit the initial data read from the db e.g. to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table. to edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing. therefore we ask the datatype if we need to re-read the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed. if there is a problem during the read (e.g. we cannot identify exactly one row in the db matching the current row in the table) then the cell is not editable. the reverse is not true - if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following pointer is needed to allow the "make editable button to tell the application to set up an editable display panel
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the list of rows may be empty in which case we just return.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save the pointer needed to enable editing of data on-demand
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there was a problem with the read it would be nice to report this to the user but if we try we get in trouble in some cases where the data is continually re-read after the dialog goes away (because the cell is being re-painted). cell is not editable

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no columns defined return a generic class to avoid anything throwing an exception.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sort the indexes into ascending order (because that is the only function easilly available from the arrays class)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to delete rows from the end of the table towards the beginning of the table. if we delete from the front to the back that throws off the indexes of the rows after each delete and we would have to compensate for that. example if we want to delete rows 2 and 4 and do it in that order then after deleteing row 2 the row that used to be row 4 is now actually row 3 so we would have to subtract 1 from the index to get the row to delete. on the other hand if we delete row 4 first then the indexes of all rows prior to that one have not been affected so we can then delete row 2 without any complications.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	delete the row from the table
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the indexes are in ascending order but we want to delete in descending order (see previous comment) so run through the list backwards.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to allow editing of read-only tables on-demand but it would be confusing to include the "make editable" option when we are already in edit mode so only allow that option when the background model is updateable and we are not already editing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just in case table is editable call creator to set up cell editors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	override the jtable method so that whenever something asks for the celleditor we save a reference to that cell editor. our assumption is that the cell editor is only requested when it is about to be activated.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if new data is same as old data in which case we do not update the underlying data. this is not an optimization (though it does speed things up). we need to do this to avoid an error when we check for rows being changed in the db. if the new value and old value are the same when we look to see if any rows already exist with the new value it will find the existing row and claim that the update will make one row identical to the changed row (i.e. that there will be two identical rows in the db) which is not true. so we avoid the problem by not updating the db if the data has not been changed. this can happen if user changes the cell contents then changes them back before exiting the cell.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the original object is not null then it contains a clob object that we need to re-use since that is the dbs reference to the clob data area. otherwise we set the original clob to null and the write method needs to know to set the field to null.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	stray sep - or we failed to find pattern
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	oracle allows statement separators in pl/sql blocks. the process of tokenizing above renders these procedure blocks as separate statements which is invalid for oracle. since "/" is the way in sql-plus to denote the end of a procedure or function we re-assemble any create procedure/function/trigger statements that we find. this should be done before expanding file includes. otherwise any create sql found in files will already be joined causing this to find create sql without matching "/". the process of expanding 'file includes' already joins the sql fragments that it finds.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jmh for additional performance we could utilise the fixed_table_sequence column from the session to investigate which rows need to be updated on a refresh see v$session doco for more info.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this seems to work for both oracle 9i and 10g
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since it is likely to have "/" on it's own line and it is key to letting us know that proceeding statements form a multi-statement procedure or function it deserves it's own place in the _queries arraylist. if it is followed by other procedure or function creation blocks we may fail to detect that so this just goes through the list and breaks apart statements on newline so that this cannot happen.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	below is equivalent to the following stringvalueresult = xmltype.getstringval()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for oracle 10g we could say something like "where xmlserialize(content " + _coldef.getlabel() +") like '<value>'" this doesn't appear to work on oracle 9i at the moment so we will avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non-null which is what the superclass implementation does. todo find a way to do this for both versions or split this behavior so that it works on 10g and is disabled on 9i.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	removed for the sqlbookmark plugin
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	removed for the tools popup
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reasons for this code mailed to rob by gerd on 9/20/2008. the problem are methods like basesqlentrypanel.getboundsofsqltobeexecuted() basesqlentrypanel.movecarettoprevioussqlbegin() they rely on the line break being a single char. also i suppose some of our code generation (scripting) functions do the same. at least i'm pretty sure if \r\n would be preserved they could produce a mixture of \n and \r\n.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	i thought this prevented gc. it doesn't but if two sessions are open and one is closed the one left open looses key bindings. for example the arrow navigation keys. getkeymap().removebindings()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the sqlsettingsinitializer added above holds a reference to the syntaxpreferences of the current session which itself holds a reference to the session. we remove the sqlsettingsinitializer to give the session the chance to get garbage collected.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only if the text did really changed (null != re.change) intervals must be adjusted. if the text did not change there is nothing to adjust.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are playing some games with the lexer for efficiency. we could just create a new lexer each time here but instead we will just reset it so that it thinks it is starting at the beginning of the document but reporting a funny start colorstartpos. reseting the lexer causes the close() method on the reader to be called but because the close() method has no effect on the documentreader we can do this.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	after the lexer has been set up scroll the reader so that it is in the correct spot as well.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the actual command that colors the stuff. color stuff with the description of the style matched to the hash table that has been set up ahead of time.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	record the colorstartpos of the last bit of text that we colored
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the interval is involved even if pos lied one point before or after the interval. this way for example we get -- select out of comment coloring when the first "-" is removed.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the ostermiller sqllexer crashes with an arrayindexoutofboundsexception if the char is greater then 255. so we prevent the char from being greater. this is surely not a proper unicode treatment but it doesn't seem to do no harm and it keeps the sqllexer working.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we will highlight tokens until we reach a good stopping place. the first obvious stopping place is the end of the document. the lexer will return null at the end of the document and wee need to stop there.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this method is called from the super class's constructor therfore _titlelbl is null for that call.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the release version doesn't change we won't be pulling down core artifacts. so we just need to make sure that all core files have been copied from their installed locations into the corresponding directory in download which is in the classpath of the updater. this covers the case where the update is being run for the first time after install and no new version is available but the user wants to install/remove plugins and/or translations.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point we have an actual file that we can output to so create the output stream (so that data type objects do not have to).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the table+column already has a data object in the map then remove it.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the text from the file since it does represent a valid data value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as a coding convenience create a reference to the text component that is typecast to jtextcomponent. this is not essential as we could typecast every reference but this makes the code cleaner

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we should never get here because the areequal function is only called when we are trying to update the database so we know that we have a datatype object for this column (or we would have been stopped from editing by the iseditablexxx methods) but we need a return here to keep the compiler happy.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get parameters previously set by user or set default values set to the default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the original object is not null then it contains a clob object that we need to re-use since that is the dbs reference to the clob data area. otherwise we set the original clob to null and the write method needs to know to set the field to null.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle mouse events for double-click creation of popup dialog. this happens only in the jtextfield not the jtextarea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the keytexthandler class.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do the conversion into the object in a safe manner special case the input is exactly the output
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this column is being limited then truncate the data if needed (start with a quick check for the data being shorter than the limit in which case we don't need to worry about it).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	when changing the backgroud color it helps to set the inner component's border to zero. otherwise the border can obscure the text and make it hard to see. this is especially seen when using the kunstoff l&f.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default behavior if no appropriate data type found is to create a simple jtextarea with no special handling. in theory this cannot happen because if there is no data type object for this column's data type then iseditableinpopup returns false so we should not get here. if there is a data type object and iseditableinpopup returns true then we would have executed the return statement above. assume that the value can be represented as a string.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	postgresql follows the standard for sql bit. it's a string of bits. so bit(10) is a string of 10 bits. jdbc treats sql bit as if it were only a single bit. it specifies that bit is equivalent to boolean. it claims that the preparedstatement set method that should be used with bit is setboolean and getboolean. this is not compliant with the standard. so sql bit type support is broken in java there is nothing we can do about that. best thing to do for now is try to convert the bit type to a boolean like the jdbc spec says and hope for the best. hope that the source database isn't using the bit column as a sequence of multiple bits.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jdbc spec says that bit refers to a boolean column - i.e. a single binary digit with value either "0" or "1". also the same spec encourages use of getboolean/setboolean. however the sql-92 standard clearly states that the bit type is a bit string with length >= 0. so for sql-92 compliant databases (like postgresql) the jdbc spec's support for bit is at best broken and unusable. still we do what the jdbc spec suggests as that is all that we can do.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there are some fields that cannot be used in a where clause either because there cannot be an exact match (e.g. real float) or because we may not have the actual data in hand (blob/clob) or because the data cannot be expressed in a string form (e.g. binary). an update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row (because we can only "see" the fields that we know how to do wheres on). therefore when we are updating them there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria (we hope). we determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the where clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the where clause. any field that can be used there will return something of the form "<fieldname> = <value>" and a field that cannot be used will return a null or zero-length string.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clobs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the db is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself. during the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read therefore we do not need to re-read the datum from the database because we know that we have the entire descriptor. if the contents of the clob have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to detect two empty text values in a row before we decide to restore the original value. since 'text' contains the new value we want to allow the first empty 'text' so that the user can clear the field and on the second one we will set it to the original value.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	value is a simple string representation of the data but not the same one used in the text and in-cell operations. the in-cell version may replace newline chars with "\n" while this version does not. in other respects it is the same as the in-cell version because both use the _renderer object to do the rendering.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have an appropriate data type object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the first argument is a jtable which is only used by instances of jtextfield to convert coordinates on a double-click. since that cannot happen with the jtextarea do not bother passing the table.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we should never not have an object here because we only get here when a datatype object has claimed that the column is editable. if there is no datatype for the column then the default in the iseditablexxx() methods in this class is to say that the column is not editable and therefore we should never have this method called in that case.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here then no data type object was found for this column. (should not get here because switch default returns null.)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now the popup-related methods. these are not quite symmetric with the in-cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to display in the popup is handled internally to the datatype object inside getjtextarea() so we do not need a "renderobjectinpopup" function visible to the rest of the world.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the rest of the world that the table has changed. the 'fire' method used here is very course - it says that the whole table has been changed when really only one row has been added. however finer-grained methods did not seem to cause the right effect so i'm using this one untill someone reports a problem with it. also if either of these notifications (the actual model and the sortable model) are eliminated it either throws an exception or does not update the gui. go figure. finally the 'fire' on the _acutalmodel is triggered from this method rather than from inside the myjtable code because the add() method used to add a row is also used when loading the table with lots of rows and in that case we do not want to generate events until all of the rows have been added so the 'fire' cannot happen there.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we use the attributes and flags from the cache but the parsed header from the parsed message
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create one list containing the marked items which have to be "unmarked" and another list containing the items remained to be marked
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resync search engine -> this is only needed for lucene right now
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	folders have same root folder -> for example two imap folders on the same server -----> this means we use server-side copying which -----> is much faster than using inputstreams here also used for local folders which saves some parsing work
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	documentparser parser = new documentparser() decode message body with respect to charset

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following lines add cut/copy/paste/undo/redo/selectall actions support using the columba action objects. this means that we only have a single instance of these specific actions which is shared by all menuitems and toolbar buttons.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	2 columns rows are added dynamically (no need to define them here)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	register as listener to the selectionmanger to check for selection changes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we don't use this here - actions like reply would only work on the the encrypted message
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no charset specified -> automatic mode -> try to determine charset based on content parameter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create attachment component with text icon tooltip context menu and double-click action
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	changing the selection to the specified row changeselection(row 0 true false)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for multipart content-types we need to take action (if boundary is nonexistent) eudora stores content type = multipart even though the message is not really multipart - e.g. because an attachment already has has been decoded by eudora)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	attachments found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store header after processing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no date header was found it is necessary to contruct a new one (this is the case for outgoing messages from eudora)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is html try to find out which charset from meta tag nb the seach for charset below is very simple. it assumes that the meta tag to find is on its own line i.e. " <meta" can be found at the beginning of the line and all the content of the tag is found on the same line! could be better but this is first shot

IMPLEMENTATION	todo adjust length so it won't fall in the middle of a multi-byte character. mri's sprintf.c uses tables in a modified version of regex.c which assume some particular encoding for a given installation/application. (see regex.c#re_mbcinit in ruby-1.8.5-p12) this is only an issue if the user specifies a precision that causes the string to be truncated. the same issue would arise taking a substring of a bytelist-backed rubystring.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing it's a non-impl method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	probably a primitive
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	interfaces are handled as modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the mirror class and parent classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the full name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include all interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it's an array only add methods for aref aset and length
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add array construction methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all public constructors (note getconstructors only returns public ones)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all instance and static methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy is complete return it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	too much array creation!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only include static methods if specified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add a few type-specific special methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all static variables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only public static fields that are valid constants
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	looks like someone's trying to raise a java exception. let them.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note the five match methods are arity-split to avoid the cost of boxing arguments when there's already a cached match. do not condense them into a single method.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	todo this is where we would want to do precision checks to see if it's non-destructive to coerce a given type into the target integral primitive
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	long first because it's what fixnum claims to be
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double first because it's what float claims to be
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	todo varargs?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	read-volatile

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize these if they haven't been
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not allowed for original (non-generated) java classes note not allowing for any previously created class right now this restriction might be loosened later for generated classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setup new etc unless this is a concretejavaproxy subclass
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first we make modifications to the class to adapt it to being both a ruby class and a proxy for a java type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	list of interfaces we implement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we capture the original "new" and make it private
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the replacement "new" allocates and inits the ruby object as before but also instantiates our proxified java object by calling __jcreate!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	next we define a few private methods that we'll use to manipulate the java object contained within this ruby object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jcreate instantiates the proxy object which implements all interfaces and which is wrapped and implemented by this object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we add an "implement" and "implement_all" methods to the class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	implement all forces implementation of all interfaces we intend for this class to implement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we've already done the above priming logic just add another interface to the list of intentions unless we're past the point of no return or already intend to implement the given interface
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	walk all superclasses aggregating interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the new interface impl and set it into the object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assuming the user wants a collection of interfaces that can be included together. make it so.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not allowed for existing java interface modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	to turn a module into an "interface collection" we add a class instance variable to hold the list of interfaces and modify append_features for this module to call append_features on each of those interfaces as well
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	already set up append_features just add the interface if we haven't already
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	array-of-interface-type creation/identity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	keep this variant for kind_of? testing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	array creation should use this variant
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	parent.setconstant(name proxyclass) where the name should come from ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	including interface module so old-style interface "subclasses" will respond correctly to #kind_of? etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add reference to interface module
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to initialize
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to initialize
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy is complete return it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	same as argument_types but matches name in java.lang.reflect.constructor/method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this point is only reached if there was an exception handler installed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	weakly reserved names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	called only by initializing thread no synchronization required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	called only by initializing thread no synchronization required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	modified only by addmethod no synchronization required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there's no constructor we must prevent construction
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	caching constructors as they're accessed for each new instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy module for interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy class for concrete classes. also used for "concrete" interfaces which is why we have two fields
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	readable only by thread building proxy so don't need to be volatile. used to handle recursive calls to getproxyclass/module while proxy is being constructed (usually when a constant defined by a class is of the same type as that class).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow proxy to be read without synchronization. if proxy is under construction only the building thread can see it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now add all aliases for the static methods (fields) as appropriate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy is under construction building thread can safely read non-volatile value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add property name aliases
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	getfoo => foo getfoo(int) => foo(int)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setfoo(foo) => foo=(foo)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isfoo() => foo isfoo() => foo()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	additionally add ?-postfixed aliases to any boolean methods and properties.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	is_something? contains_thing?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	something?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setup constants for public inner classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setup constants for public inner classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore bad constant named inner classes pending jruby-697
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore bad constant named inner classes pending jruby-697
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create constructorinstaller if there are no constructors it will disable construction
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to collect all methods though we'll only install the ones that are named in this class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	install direct java methods with mangled name so 'send' can call them directly.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now iterate over all installers and make sure they also have appropriate aliases
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	old (quasi-deprecated) interface class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	1.9 support for encodings
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double-check the cache now that we're synchronized
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setfoo(foo) => foo=(foo)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isfoo() => foo isfoo() => foo()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	is_something? contains_thing?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one word type name that starts lower-caseit may be a primitive type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	java.getproxyclass deals with sync issues so we won't duplicate the logic here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note intentionally returning the actual array returned from java rather than wrapping it in a rubyarray. wave of the future when java_class will return the actual class rather than a javaclass wrapper.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see note above re return type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	restrictive security policy no matter we only want public classes anyway
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	very restrictive policy (disallows member.public) we'd never actually get this far in that case
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one-dimensional array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	n-dimensional array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it's an array of arrays recurse with the component type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we all all superclasses but avoid adding superclass methods with same name+signature as subclass methods see jruby-3130
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proc implementing an interface pull in the catch-all code that lets the proc get invoked no matter what method is called on the interface
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can't be converted any more return it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	getfoobar() => foobar? foo_bar?()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if not a property but is boolean add ?-postfixed aliases.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	many cases are ok to convert to float if not one of these error
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for object default to natural wrapper type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	rubyobject is already of the required jruby class (or subclass)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the converters handle not only primitive types but also their boxed versions so we should check if we have a converter before checking for isprimitive()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it's not one of the types we convert so just pass it out as-is without wrapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we've found a java type to which we've coerced the ruby value wrap it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set of utility methods for java-based proxy objects
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the proxy (wrapper) type hierarchy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	interfacejavaproxy.createinterfacejavaproxy(context)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	also create the javaproxy classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the template for interface modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now attach java-related extras to core classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all name-to-class mappings
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add some base java classes everyone will need
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finally set javasupport.isenabled to true
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	shouldn't happen but if a superclass is specified it's not ours
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include any interfaces we extend
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	java.lang.object is added at root of java proxy classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	other java proxy classes added under their superclass' java proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include interface modules into the proxy class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jruby-2938 the proxy class might already exist
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add java_method for unbound use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add alias to meta
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we'll only map conventional class names to modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	expected
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	haven't found a class continue on as though it were a package
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	upper case name so most likely a class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this point is only reached if there was an exception handler installed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add alias to meta
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is where we'll get connected when classes are opened using package module syntax.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save package module as ivar in parent and add method to parent so we don't have to come back here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this covers primitives and (unlikely) lower-case class names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not primitive or lc class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not primitive or lc class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	is there a supplied proc argument or do we assume a block was supplied
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create list of interfaces to proxy (and make sure they really are interfaces)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hashcode is a combination of the interfaces and the ruby class we're using to implement them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it's a singleton class and the real class is proc we're doing closure conversion so just use proc's hashcode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	normal new class implementing interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize some components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not synchronizing these methods no harm if these values get set more than once. (also note that there's no chance of getting a partially initialized class/module as happens-before is guaranteed by volatile write/read of constants table.)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	java reflection does not allow retrieving constructors like methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for zero args case we can stop searching
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for zero args case we can stop searching
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no matching ctor found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create ruby proxies for any input arguments that are not primitives.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	prepare a faster handle if handles are enabled and the method and class are public
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be a public method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be a public class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must have been loaded from our known classloader hierarchy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special classes like collections.empty_list are inner classes that are private but implement public interfaces. their methods are all public methods for the public interface. let these public methods execute via setaccessible(true).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	search through all declared methods to find a closest match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no matching method found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this test really means that this is a ruby-defined subclass of a java class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first we need to register the jruby engine.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we create a new bsfmanager.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize a simple frame.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	e.printstacktrace()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	e.printstacktrace()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jruby-530 while case
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this test really means that this is a ruby-defined subclass of a java class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for our purposes accessibles are also members and vice-versa so we'll include member methods here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	declare those components as beans in bsf. then it will be possible to access those components in ruby as global variables ($frame $menubar )
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	execute a ruby script (add the menubar to the frame).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	execute ruby statements.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	evaluates a ruby expression and display the result.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	populate values for the parameter names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	package scope
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this point is only reached if there was an exception handler installed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ruby-level methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need names ordered for key generation later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we only collect methods and interfaces for user-defined proxy classes.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get javaclass if this is the new proxy class verify it matches if this is a superclass proxy.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get any included interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	lock in the overridden methods for the new class and any as-yet uninstantiated ancestor class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	statically initialized below

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	trigger class initialization for the class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not happen!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	start class

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add (potentially) overridden names to the key. todo see note above re optimizations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we generate all constructors and let some fail during invocation later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create static private method field
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	load static empty array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	box arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a simple rethrow handler
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the super-proxy method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do a void return
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	utility methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	is there a supplied proc argument or do we assume a block was supplied
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store call information so method_missing impl can use it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the same logic as in evaluationstate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no opt no rest exact match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only rest must be at least required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	opt but no rest must be at least required and no more than required + opt
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	opt and rest must be at least required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no block from a nil proc
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if not already a proc then we should try and make it one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the current block is already associated with proc. no need to create a new one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	has the method that is calling super received a block argument
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	nul
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reuse trailing consecutive sequence at same slot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clone all remaining nodes

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	each root node has a top-level scope that we need to push
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	read-volatile
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	read-volatile
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classes are directly in the hierarchy so no special logic is necessary for implementer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be power of 2 must be power of 2
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find power-of-two sizes best matching arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note segmentshift differs from concurrenthashmap's calculation due to issues with system.identityhashcode (upper n bits always 0 at least under java 1.6 / winxp)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	system.err.println("objectproxycache " + id + " started at "+ new java.util.date())
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected void finalize() throws throwable { system.err.println("objectproxycache " + id + " finalized at "+ new java.util.date()) }
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	entryrefs include hash with key to facilitate lookup by segment#expunge after ref is removed from referencequeue
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unlike weakhashmap our entry does not subclass weakreference but rather makes it a final field. the theory is that doing so should force a happens-before relationship wrt the weakreference constructor guaranteeing that the key will be visibile to other threads (unless it's been gc'ed). see jls 17.5 (final fields) and 17.4.5 (happens-before order) to confirm or refute my reasoning here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	references to the java object and its proxy will either both be weak or both be soft since the proxy contains a strong reference to the object so it wouldn't make sense for the reference types to differ.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ctor used by remove/rehash
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be called under lock
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be called under lock

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	determine what sort of assigner should be used for the provided 'iter' (e.g. block). assigner provides just the right logic for assigning values to local parameters of the block. this method also has a second optimization which is to set 'noargblock' in the case that the block is a block which accepts no arguments. the primary reason for this second optimization is that in the case of a yield with a rubyarray we will bypass some logic processing the rubyarray into a proper form (only to then not do anythign with it). a secondary benefit is that a simple boolean seems to optimize by hotspot much faster than the zero arg assigner.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we create one extra dynamicscope on a binding so that when we 'eval "b=1" binding' the 'b' will get put into this new dynamic scope. the original scope does not see the new 'b' and successive evals with this binding will. i take it having the ability to have succesive binding evals be able to share same scope makes sense from a programmers perspective. one crappy outcome of this design is it requires dynamic and static scopes to be mutable for this one case.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unfortunately the number of digits in the exponent is not clearly defined in ruby documentation. this is a platform/version-dependent behavior. on linux/mac/cygwinnix two digits are used. on windows 3 digits are used. it is desirable for jruby to have consistent behavior and the two digits behavior was selected. this is also in sync with "java-native" sprintf behavior (java.util.formatter). e or e
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	represents the the dynamic portion of scoping information. the variablevalues are the values of assigned local or block variables. the staticscope identifies which sort of scope this is (block or local). properties of dynamic scopes 1. static and dynamic scopes have the same number of names to values 2. size of variables (and thus names) is determined during parsing. so those structured do not need to change fixme when creating dynamic scopes we sometimes accidentally pass in extra parents. this is harmless (other than wasting memory) but we should not do that. we can fix this in two ways 1. fix all callers 2. check parent that is passed in and make if new instance is local then its parent is not local

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the problem we trying to solve below stdin in java is blocked and non-interruptible so if we invoke read on it we might never be able to interrupt such thread. so we use in.available() to see if there is any input ready and only then read it. but this approach can't tell whether the end of stream reached or not so we might end up looping right at the end of the stream. well at least we can improve the situation by checking if some input was ever available and if so not checking for available anymore and just go to read.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an additional note on using hashsets to store urls i just discovered that obtaining the hashcode of a java.net.url implies a domain-name resolution process. this means significant delays can occur even more so if the domain name is not resolvable. whether this can be a problem in practical situations i can't tell but thought i'd keep a note just in case btw note that using a list and removing duplicates via scan would not help since url.equals requires name resolution too. the above problem has now been addressed with the urlstring and urlcollection classes.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if a blank headermanager exists try to get the soaphttpconnection. after the first request there should be a connection object stored with the cookie header info.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the auth. thanks to kiyun roe for contributing the patch i cleaned up the patch slightly. 5-26-05
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check the proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if use proxy is set we try to pick up the proxy host and port from either the text fields or from jmeterutil if they were passed from command line
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if for some reason the host is blank and the port is zero the sampler will fail silently
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	api uses raw types
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is not possible to access the actual http response code so we assume no data means failure
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	scheme used for slow http sockets. cannot be set as a default because must be set on an httpclient instance.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we always want to override the https scheme because we want to trust all certificates and hosts
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	$non-nls-1$
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	$non-nls-1$
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	done with the sampling proper.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now collect the results into the httpsampleresult
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we redirected automatically the url may have changed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store any cookies received in the cookie manager
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save cache information
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	condensed length (without \r) add \r for each header add \r for initial header final \r\n before data
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	by not reading the response for real it improves the performance on slow clients
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reponse code doesn't really apply since the soap driver doesn't provide a response code

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note that samplestarted() and samplestopped() is not made to appear in synch with sampleoccured() when replaying held samples. for now this is not critical since samplestarted() and samplestopped() is not used but it may become an issue in the future. then these events must also be stored so that replay of all events may occur and in the right order. each stored event must then be tagged with something that lets you distinguish between occured started and ended.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow testresultwrapper to feed back the samples this is effectively the same as saver.fromxml(inputstream) except we get to provide the dataholder don't know why there is no method for this in the xstream class

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	converts null to length-zero array and clones array to ensure immutability.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checks whether the string contains any more segments after the one that starts at position i.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	validates all of the uri components. factory methods should call this before using the constructor though they must ensure that the inter-component requirements described in their own javadocs are all satisfied themselves. if a new uri is being constructed out of an existing uri this need not be called. instead just the new components may be validated individually.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	alternate stricter implementations of the following validation methods are provided commented out for possible future use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid scheme may be null or consist of a single letter followed by any number of letters numbers and the following characters <code>+ - .</code>
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid opaque part must be non-null and non-empty. it may contain any allowed uri characters but its first character may not be <code>/</code>

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	relative path merge with base and keep query (note if the base has no path and this a non-empty relative path there is an implied root in the resulting path)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always keep fragment even if null and use scheme from base no validation needed since all components are from existing uris
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a stack to accumulate segments of base except for the last (i.e. skip trailing separator and anything following it) and of relative path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	adds a segment to a stack skipping empty segments and self references and interpreting parent references.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special care must be taken for a root's parent reference it is either ignored or the symbolic reference itself is pushed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unless we're already accumulating root parent references parent references simply pop the last segment descended
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note these assertions imply that neither this nor the base uri has a relative path thus both have either an absolute path or no path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the shortest relative path between the the non-relative path of the given base and this absolute path. if the base has no path it is treated as the root absolute path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note that the copied tree should not be modified by wrapped astjfield the copied tree will have source ranges for all nodes in the source file hence the get methods in the new astjfield will not return the right contents
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a single separator possibly preceded by some parent reference segments is redundant
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an empty path needs to be replaced by a single "." if there is no query to distinguish it from a current document reference
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collapses non-ending empty segments parent references and self references in a non-relative path returning the same path that would be produced from the base hierarchical uri as part of a resolve.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the path is non-empty and originally ended in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns a string representation of this uri for debugging explicitly showing each of the components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the new prefix has segments it is not the root absolute path and we need to drop the trailing empty segment and append the tail segments.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this is a hierarchical uri reference and prefix is a prefix of it returns the portion of the path remaining after that prefix has been trimmed null otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don't even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this must have no fewer segments than the prefix. since the prefix is not the root absolute path its last segment is empty all others must match.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create new field and replace it all by original contents
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the prefix really is a prefix of this. if this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	encodes a complete uri optionally leaving % characters unescaped when beginning a valid three-character escape sequence. we can either treat the first or # as a fragment separator or encode them all.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	range to look for comments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	encodes the given string replacing each ascii character that is not in the set specified by the 128-bit bitmask and each non-ascii character below 0xa0 by an escape sequence of % followed by two hex digits. if % is not in the set but ignoreescaped is true then % will not be encoded iff it already begins a valid escape sequence.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests whether an escape occurs in the given string starting at index i. an escape sequence is a % followed by two hex digits.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find start position of farthest preceding comment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the byte is automatically widened into an int with sign extension for shifting. this can introduce 1's to the left of the byte which must be cleared by masking before looking up the hex digit.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the character encoded by % followed by the two given hex digits which is always 0xff or less so can safely be casted to a byte. if either character is not a hex digit a bogus result will be returned.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the plugin.properties isn't within the root of the archive create a new uri for the folder location of the archive so we can look in the folder that contains it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we didn't find the plugin.properties in the usual place nor in the archive
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we can open an input stream then the plugin.properties is in the folder and we have a good base url.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we still don't have a good base url complain about it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don't create an iterator stack until the root mapping itself has been returned by next once. after that the stack should be non-empty and the top iterator should yield true for hasnext.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we're creating a child under an object in a feature map the selection will be the feature map entry. we want to replace it with the model object.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there isn't an executable command we should maybe try a link operation but only if we're allowed and not doing a link.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only return the feedback for an executable command.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no image is a good default.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add it to the list and remove it from the other list.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	commands should operate on the values not their wrappers. if the command's values needed to be unwrapped we'll back get a new commandparameter.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this came from trial and error yielding decent results on all platforms. it should be consistent with activate().
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we don't already have it try to get the source early. we can't give feedback if it's not available yet (this is platform-dependent).

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	common to all uri types.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a cache of uris keyed by the strings from which they were created. the fragment of any uri is removed before caching it here to minimize the size of the cache in the usual case where most uris only differ by the fragment.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the lower-cased schemes that will be used to identify archive uris.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special segment values interpreted at resolve and resolve time.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some character classes as defined in rfc 2396's bnf for uri. these are 128-bit bitmasks stored as two longs where the nth bit is set iff the ascii character with value n is included in the set. these are created with the highbitmask() and lowbitmask() methods defined below and a character is tested against them using matches().
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	| ucschar | escaped
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we can't want to do encoding of platform resource uris by default yet.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns the upper half bitmask for all the ascii characters in the given string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	uses a cache to speed up creation of a uri from a string. the cache is consulted to see if the uri less any fragment has already been created. if needed the fragment is re-appended to the cached uri which is considerably more efficient than creating the whole uri from scratch. if the uri wasn't found in the cache it is created using parseintouri() and then cached. this method should always be used by string-parsing factory methods instead of parseintouri() directly.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finds the next occurrence of one of the characters in the set represented by the given bitmask in the given string beginning at index i. the index of the first found character or s.length() if there is none is returned. before searching i is limited to the range [0 s.length()].
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	boolean iri = false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	iri = iri || containsnonascii(segments[i])
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	<p>a valid query may be null or contain any allowed uri characters.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return value == null || validate(value uric_hi uric_lo true true)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests the non-null string value to see if it contains only ascii characters in the set represented by the specified 128-bit bitmask as well as optionally non-ascii characters 0xa0 and above and also optionally escape sequences of % followed by two hex digits. this method is used for the new strict uri validation that is not not currently in place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note authority == null -> hierarchical (authority == null && device == null && !absolutepath) -> scheme == null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	current document reference use base path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else keep device path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else keep authority device path and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	merges this uri's relative path with the base non-relative path. if base has no path treat it as the root absolute path unless this has no path either.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the relative path is empty or ends in an empty segment a parent reference or a self reference add a trailing separator to a non-empty path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since base must be hierarchical and since a non-hierarchical uri must have both scheme and opaque part the complete absolute uri is needed to resolve to a non-hierarchical uri
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	path form demands an absolute path keep it and query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always include fragment even if null no validation needed since all components are from existing uris
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns true if the non-relative path includes segments that would be collapsed when resolving false otherwise. if preserverootparents is true collapsible segments include any empty segments except for the last segment as well as and parent and self references. if preserverootsparents is false parent references are not collapsible if they are the first segment or preceded only by other parent references.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if endpath is shorter than startpath the last segment of endpath may not be compared because startpath has been collapsed and had its last segment removed all preceding segments can be considered non- empty and followed by a separator while the last segment of endpath will either be non-empty and not followed by a separator or just empty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	absolute path or no path -> absolute path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	computes a three-character escape sequence for the byte appending it to the stringbuffer. only characters up to 0xff should be escaped all but the least significant byte will be ignored.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	returns <code>true</code> if this uri contains non-ascii characters <code>false</code> otherwise. this unused code is included for possible future use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if that fails determine the url for the class itself. the url will be of one of the following forms so there are a few good places to consider looking for the plugin.properties. for a plugin.xml with runtime="common.jar" jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="runtime/common.jar" jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/runtime/common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="." where the plugin is jarred jarfile/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common.jar!/org/eclipse/common/commonplugin.class for a plugin.xml with runtime="." where the plugin is not jarred. file/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/org/eclipse/emf/common/commonplugin.class running in pde with bin on classpath file/d/sandbox/unpackage1-3.1m7/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.common/bin/org/eclipse/emf/common/commonplugin.class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we can open an input stream then the plugin.properties is there and we have a good base url.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the bundle can't be found the normal way try to find it as the base url. if that also doesn't work rethrow the original exception.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the index was previously assigned return it. otherwise return a negative result that encodes the newly assigned index.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we set it and get back the interned string. this way when instanceclassname == instancetypename we know we should serialize only the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the container class must be null for the open content features of the document root to ensure that they are looked up in the actual eclass() rather than assumed to be a feature with a feature id relative to the actual class. otherwise it's good to have this optimization.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not want to diagnose any errors that have already been diagnosed by a super type. although we ignore all the first super's features there may be mixin classes that still would result in duplicates.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is no match if the types are different and they don't each specify the same non-null instance class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is built-in and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	and even if it is contained it must not be a forward reference. etypeparameterindex == index is allowed when the type parameter is the type argument of the bound though
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a primitive type can only be used as the generic type of a typed element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check if the bound specifies a classifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since we will do the processing recursively we need to ensure we don't stack overflow if there is a circular super type.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cc
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the entity handler is the best place to resolve and deresolve uris since it can do it there just once to produce the entity. so most often the entity handler will be a uri handler as well and when used as a uri handler will be an identity handler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle the same document proxies which may have problems resulting from the other end of a bidirectional reference being handled as an idref rather than as a proxy. when we are done with these we know that funny proxies are now resolved as if they were handled as idrefs.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	so if the resolved object is also present
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there is no root object we're dealing with an eattribute feature instead of an ereference feature. so create an instance of simple any type and prepare it to handle the text content.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include only non-duplicate namespace declarations.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to be careful that we don't end up requiring the no namespace package just because the feature is unqualified.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resolve relative uri to base uri - see rfc 2396 section 5.2 in some cases it might make more sense to throw an exception (when scheme is specified is the string spec and the base uri is also specified for example) but we're just following the rfc specifications

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	rfc 2396 states that hostnames take the form described in rfc 1034 (section 3) and rfc 1123 (section 2.1). according to rfc 1034 hostnames are limited to 255 characters.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	domain labels can contain alphanumerics and '-" but must start and end with an alphanumeric
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	rfc 1034 labels must be 63 characters or less.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that that there are no more than three digits in this segment.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that this segment is not greater than 255.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	address must contain 128-bits of information.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	'' represents at least one 16-bit group of zeros.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	trailing zeros will fill out the rest of the address.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the second character wasn't '' in order to be valid the remainder of the string must match ipv4address and we must have read exactly 6 16-bit groups.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	3. scan hex sequence after ''.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we've either reached the end of the string the address ends in an ipv4 address or it is invalid. scanhexsequence has already made sure that we have the right number of bits.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	walk the project looking for .java files to analyze.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we have resolved to an eclass but we have an eattribute we can change it to be an ereference.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we need to hook up opposites by finding the named feature in the type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	containers are transient by default unless explicitly annotated otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we need to hook up keys by finding the named feature in the type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clean up the temporary container annotations for holding map entry classes until they are for sure needed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we should sort.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	iterate over all projects to look at the manifests.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	determine the required plugins.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	iterate over all the plugin ids to determine the dependency closure. the list grows as the plugins are visited.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	walk the fields.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the epackage on demand.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check whether this has @model annotation contents. if not it might be a package interface for backwards compatibility.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the package name and see if there's an epackage for it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it's an interface then it will be treated as an eclass
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create a generic super type with an eclass as the classifier for each super interface in the java representation.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	map to an eenum.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the feature name is extracted lower cased.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the name is extracted and lower cased.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	each token in parameters will specify a datatype for the corresponding parameter but can be overridden by a parameter-name-prefixed datatype property.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for lists maps and feature maps the default is many-valued which can be overridden by an upper-bound declaration.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the type can be augmented by specifying the it explicitly in the annotation. this mostly makes sense only for many-valued typed elements where the java type is a list and the item type needs to be specified.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow a distinct literal value to be provided too.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create classes and their features
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow a mixed case version of the name to be provided.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check if the name is qualified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays consider the element type.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we can't find it try the simple name in the package
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find the modeled package for the name and look up the name there.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we still don't have one we'll have to settle for an edatatype or eclass with an instance class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remember the static instance.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize package
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see if we already have the edatatype.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just to be helpful we'll recognize a type of org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.featuremap and convert it to efeaturemapentry. this way a datatype need not be specified. but we won't do this if recorddemandcreateedatatype is false so we don't change the instanceclass of a new edatatype that's implicitly being defined for featuremap.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we don't have one yet maybe it's one of the special types
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we still don't have one we'll have to settle for a demand created edatatype or eclass so create a new eclassifier with a nice unique name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the name isn't qualified it might be a primitive or from java.lang. otherwise assume it's in the current package and use the nsprefix for the qualified package name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	even primitives should be represented by a data type with a conventional (i.e. capitalized) name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make array names legal.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	avoid classifier name collisions.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since input objects are read-only we don't need to make a copy of them for the clipboard. we can just put a pointer to the original object(s) on the clipboard.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do we also have some non-input objects to copy?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just remember it it's encoded later during execution which is more efficient.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do the encoding.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for each mapping being added
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check all the siblings to see which if any should now be nested under this new mapping. the are accumulated into a list so that they can be removed as a single command with a single notification.
