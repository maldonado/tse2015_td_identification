IMPLEMENTATION	todo the copy function is not yet completely implemented - so we will have some exceptions here and there.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo a better implementation would be to batch events into logical groups and update the tree one time for the entire group synchronizing access to the model repository so that it stays consistent during the query. this would likely require doing the updates in a different thread than the event delivery thread to prevent deadlocks so for right now we protect ourselves with try/catch blocks.

IMPLEMENTATION	now we know that this critic is still valid. what we need to figure out is if the corresponding to-do item is still valid. the to-do item is to be replaced if the name of some offender has changed that affects its description or if the contents of the list of offenders has changed. we check that by creating a new todoitem and then verifying that it looks exactly the same. this really creates a lot of to-do items that goes to waste.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not implemented yet. the idea is that some problems identified by critic's can be fixed with certain design manipulations (or transforms) that can be applied automatically to resolve the problem. this method replies true iff the given problem can be fixed. the fixit() method actually does the fix. @see org.argouml.cognitive.poster#canfixit(org.argouml.cognitive.todoitem) also @see critic#fixit

IMPLEMENTATION	get the innermost containing model of a modelelement. <p> if no containing model can be found the outermost containing modelelement is returned (which could be the original element itself if it has no owner). <p> this method is intended to return the innermost containing model but there are circumstances where one may really expect the outermost containing model or root package to be returned (e.g. where it's being used to test if two elements are from disjoint namespace hierarchies). hence there are two separate methods with different semantics. the method {@link #getroot(object)} returns the outermost containing object. <p> todo note also that some code uses org.argouml.kernel.project#getroot() to navigate down from the top instead of up from the bottom. we need to use a consistent algorithm for this. - tfm 20070724 @param handle to the model element. @return model for the model element.

IMPLEMENTATION	the drag gesture listener is notified of drag gestures by a recognizer. the typical response is to initiate a drag by invoking dragsource.startdrag(). <p> todo find a way to show a different image when multiple elements are dragged. @param draggestureevent the draggestureevent describing the gesture that has just occurred @see java.awt.dnd.draggesturelistener#draggesturerecognized(java.awt.dnd.draggestureevent)
IMPLEMENTATION	the list with objects that should be shown in the combobox. todo using a list here forces a linear search when we're trying to add a new element to the model which can be very slow for large models.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better to defer this initialization until the panel actually needs to be displayed. perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later if we've got something to display - tfm - 20070110
IMPLEMENTATION	finds the operation to which a callevent refers based on the given transition. this function determines the context of the statemachine that contains the given transition. if the context is a classifier then all operations of this classifier are candidates. if the context is a behavioralfeature then all operations of the owner classifier are candidates. the first operation of which the name matches is the result. for activity diagrams if the context is a package then all operations of all classifiers in the package are candidates. todo this function works for the most normal cases but needs some testing for rare cases e.g. internal transitions todo the parameters of the candidates are ignored. maybe this method should return a set of matching operations. @author mvw @param trans object of type transition @param opname the name of the operation sought @return object the operation with the given name or null

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is a bug in the version of mdr (20050711) that we use that causes it to fail to delete aggregate elements which are single valued and where the aggregate end is listed second in the association defined in the metamodel. for the uml 1.4 metamodel this affects a statemachine's top statevertex and a transition's guard. see issue 4948 & 5227 - tfm 20080713
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in uml 1.3 the name is the only place to store text. in uml 1.4 there is a body as well but some tools still seem to use name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	although not represented in the ocl (or our java) the english text of wfr #4 of section 2.10.3.4 in the uml 1.4 spec is more restrictive - "[4] a collaboration may only contain classifierroles and associationroles the generalizations and the constraints between them and actions used in the collaboration's interactions."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following from the original nsuml implemenetation was attempting to implement wfr #1 from section 2.5.3.32 of the uml 1.4 spec but if there is an owner set no namespace is valid. the checks for this wfr if desired need to go in setowner() and settype() - tfm

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this comment was included in a previous version (before 1/2005) of the test which had this assertion commented out ------ interaction should not be removed when removing classifierrole maybe if the last message is removed from the interaction but even then it's doubtfull since it will probably lead to backward compatibility problems in save formats. ------ but my reading of the uml 1.4 specification is that an interaction without at least one message is definitely illegal so mdr is doing the right thing by removing it in this case where we only have a single message which then gets deleted. - tfm
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get a list of uml metaclass names from the xmi document. <p> though some of the dom methods such as getattributes may return null values under other conditions in the context of this test and assuming a valid xmi file none should occur. <p> hence there is no special checking for those abnormal cases allowing the test to fail simply with a nullpointerexception with this comment indicating that either the input data is incorrect or the test needs to be improved.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test creating modelelements from a given notation and then re-generate the notation-string again and check if they are equal. some of these tests are not very usefulll since they may fail on white space differences. todo white space should best be ignored.

IMPLEMENTATION	move any i18n files that are located in the core downloads dir to the i18n downloads dir. the spring application context will not load properly (for some unknown reason) when there are i18n jars in the classpath. so as a work-around we simply ensure that they are where they should be anyway. previously we were not as careful about this so it is possible that i18n jars were copied into the core downloads directory.

IMPLEMENTATION	todo if the use checks "export entire table" and doesn't select all then the selected indices are not set and this check doesn't properly detect missing data. if export entire table is selected we need to set the selected indexes below correctly.
IMPLEMENTATION	we just copied the last table. now it is safe to copy the constraints.(well that is if all fk dependencies are met in the group of tables being copied. todo new feature could be to examine table list for fk's in tables not in the list then prompt the user to add those missing tables to the list.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe someday we could inform the user that the imported key can't be created because the list of tables they've selected doesn't include the table that this foreign key depends upon. for now just log a warning and skip it.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if file name default and cmd is null or empty make sure this entry is not being held in cellimportexportinfosaver
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save the user options - we know that it is not the default because we do not allow importing from "temp file"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	user has not entered anything or has reset to defaults so make sure there is no entry for this column in the saved info
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the real name for use later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now that we have the file do the import. note the sequence of operations is divided into two sections at this point. the preceeding code ensures that we have a readable file and the code in the following method call does the import. the reason for splitting at this point is that the execute operation needs to do an import and it will already have the file to do the import from (which is the same as the file it exported into).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	file name verification operations are the same for both export and execute so do that work here for both. if file name is null or empty do not proceed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the file to open

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have done everything we can prior to this point to ensure that the the file is accessible but it is still possible that an existing file was removed at a bad moment. also the compiler insists that we put this in a try statement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	file exists is normal and is writable so see if user wants to overwrite contents of file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	user is ok with overwriting file we do not need to do anything special to overwrite (as opposed to appending) since the outputstring starts at the beginning of the file by default.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we could tell user here that export was canceled but i don't think its necessary and that avoids forcing user to do yet another annoying mouse click.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here then everything worked correctly so tell user that data was put into file. this is different from the import strategy because the user may not know the name of the file that was used if they selected the automatic temp file operation or they may not know what directory the file was actually put into so this tells them the full file path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this may be called either when the table is editable or when it is read-only. when it is read-only there is no command to be saved but when it is editable there may be a command.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if user did anything other than default then save their options

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for possibly bad return from child
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the dataobject returns a string to put into the popup which can later be converted to the appropriate object type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	command returned non-standard value. ask user before proceeding.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end of combined export and execute operations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the file was a temp file delete it now. we assume that export-only operations want to leave the file in place but execute operations just want a temp space to work with and do not want it lying around afterwards.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is handy to have the cannonical path name to show user in error messages. since getting that name might involve an ioexception we need to put it inside a try statement. however since the file does exist there is no good reason for getting an ioexception at this point but if we get one there is something seriously wrong and we want to abort. therefore it make sense to get that name here and save it for later use.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the imput stream (so that datatype objects don't have to)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hand file input stream to datatype object for import also handle file io errors here so that datatype objects do not have to.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no need for conversion

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datatypes may limit the initial data read from the db e.g. to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table. to edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing. therefore we ask the datatype if we need to re-read the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed. if there is a problem during the read (e.g. we cannot identify exactly one row in the db matching the current row in the table) then the cell is not editable. the reverse is not true - if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following pointer is needed to allow the "make editable button to tell the application to set up an editable display panel
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the list of rows may be empty in which case we just return.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save the pointer needed to enable editing of data on-demand
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there was a problem with the read it would be nice to report this to the user but if we try we get in trouble in some cases where the data is continually re-read after the dialog goes away (because the cell is being re-painted). cell is not editable

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no columns defined return a generic class to avoid anything throwing an exception.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sort the indexes into ascending order (because that is the only function easilly available from the arrays class)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to delete rows from the end of the table towards the beginning of the table. if we delete from the front to the back that throws off the indexes of the rows after each delete and we would have to compensate for that. example if we want to delete rows 2 and 4 and do it in that order then after deleteing row 2 the row that used to be row 4 is now actually row 3 so we would have to subtract 1 from the index to get the row to delete. on the other hand if we delete row 4 first then the indexes of all rows prior to that one have not been affected so we can then delete row 2 without any complications.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	delete the row from the table
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the indexes are in ascending order but we want to delete in descending order (see previous comment) so run through the list backwards.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to allow editing of read-only tables on-demand but it would be confusing to include the "make editable" option when we are already in edit mode so only allow that option when the background model is updateable and we are not already editing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just in case table is editable call creator to set up cell editors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	override the jtable method so that whenever something asks for the celleditor we save a reference to that cell editor. our assumption is that the cell editor is only requested when it is about to be activated.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if new data is same as old data in which case we do not update the underlying data. this is not an optimization (though it does speed things up). we need to do this to avoid an error when we check for rows being changed in the db. if the new value and old value are the same when we look to see if any rows already exist with the new value it will find the existing row and claim that the update will make one row identical to the changed row (i.e. that there will be two identical rows in the db) which is not true. so we avoid the problem by not updating the db if the data has not been changed. this can happen if user changes the cell contents then changes them back before exiting the cell.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the original object is not null then it contains a clob object that we need to re-use since that is the dbs reference to the clob data area. otherwise we set the original clob to null and the write method needs to know to set the field to null.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	stray sep - or we failed to find pattern
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	oracle allows statement separators in pl/sql blocks. the process of tokenizing above renders these procedure blocks as separate statements which is invalid for oracle. since "/" is the way in sql-plus to denote the end of a procedure or function we re-assemble any create procedure/function/trigger statements that we find. this should be done before expanding file includes. otherwise any create sql found in files will already be joined causing this to find create sql without matching "/". the process of expanding 'file includes' already joins the sql fragments that it finds.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jmh for additional performance we could utilise the fixed_table_sequence column from the session to investigate which rows need to be updated on a refresh see v$session doco for more info.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this seems to work for both oracle 9i and 10g
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since it is likely to have "/" on it's own line and it is key to letting us know that proceeding statements form a multi-statement procedure or function it deserves it's own place in the _queries arraylist. if it is followed by other procedure or function creation blocks we may fail to detect that so this just goes through the list and breaks apart statements on newline so that this cannot happen.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	below is equivalent to the following stringvalueresult = xmltype.getstringval()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for oracle 10g we could say something like "where xmlserialize(content " + _coldef.getlabel() +") like '<value>'" this doesn't appear to work on oracle 9i at the moment so we will avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non-null which is what the superclass implementation does. todo find a way to do this for both versions or split this behavior so that it works on 10g and is disabled on 9i.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	removed for the sqlbookmark plugin
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	removed for the tools popup
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reasons for this code mailed to rob by gerd on 9/20/2008. the problem are methods like basesqlentrypanel.getboundsofsqltobeexecuted() basesqlentrypanel.movecarettoprevioussqlbegin() they rely on the line break being a single char. also i suppose some of our code generation (scripting) functions do the same. at least i'm pretty sure if \r\n would be preserved they could produce a mixture of \n and \r\n.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	i thought this prevented gc. it doesn't but if two sessions are open and one is closed the one left open looses key bindings. for example the arrow navigation keys. getkeymap().removebindings()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the sqlsettingsinitializer added above holds a reference to the syntaxpreferences of the current session which itself holds a reference to the session. we remove the sqlsettingsinitializer to give the session the chance to get garbage collected.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only if the text did really changed (null != re.change) intervals must be adjusted. if the text did not change there is nothing to adjust.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are playing some games with the lexer for efficiency. we could just create a new lexer each time here but instead we will just reset it so that it thinks it is starting at the beginning of the document but reporting a funny start colorstartpos. reseting the lexer causes the close() method on the reader to be called but because the close() method has no effect on the documentreader we can do this.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	after the lexer has been set up scroll the reader so that it is in the correct spot as well.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the actual command that colors the stuff. color stuff with the description of the style matched to the hash table that has been set up ahead of time.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	record the colorstartpos of the last bit of text that we colored
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the interval is involved even if pos lied one point before or after the interval. this way for example we get -- select out of comment coloring when the first "-" is removed.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the ostermiller sqllexer crashes with an arrayindexoutofboundsexception if the char is greater then 255. so we prevent the char from being greater. this is surely not a proper unicode treatment but it doesn't seem to do no harm and it keeps the sqllexer working.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we will highlight tokens until we reach a good stopping place. the first obvious stopping place is the end of the document. the lexer will return null at the end of the document and wee need to stop there.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this method is called from the super class's constructor therfore _titlelbl is null for that call.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the release version doesn't change we won't be pulling down core artifacts. so we just need to make sure that all core files have been copied from their installed locations into the corresponding directory in download which is in the classpath of the updater. this covers the case where the update is being run for the first time after install and no new version is available but the user wants to install/remove plugins and/or translations.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point we have an actual file that we can output to so create the output stream (so that data type objects do not have to).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the table+column already has a data object in the map then remove it.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the text from the file since it does represent a valid data value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as a coding convenience create a reference to the text component that is typecast to jtextcomponent. this is not essential as we could typecast every reference but this makes the code cleaner

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we should never get here because the areequal function is only called when we are trying to update the database so we know that we have a datatype object for this column (or we would have been stopped from editing by the iseditablexxx methods) but we need a return here to keep the compiler happy.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get parameters previously set by user or set default values set to the default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the original object is not null then it contains a clob object that we need to re-use since that is the dbs reference to the clob data area. otherwise we set the original clob to null and the write method needs to know to set the field to null.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle mouse events for double-click creation of popup dialog. this happens only in the jtextfield not the jtextarea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the keytexthandler class.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do the conversion into the object in a safe manner special case the input is exactly the output
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this column is being limited then truncate the data if needed (start with a quick check for the data being shorter than the limit in which case we don't need to worry about it).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	when changing the backgroud color it helps to set the inner component's border to zero. otherwise the border can obscure the text and make it hard to see. this is especially seen when using the kunstoff l&f.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default behavior if no appropriate data type found is to create a simple jtextarea with no special handling. in theory this cannot happen because if there is no data type object for this column's data type then iseditableinpopup returns false so we should not get here. if there is a data type object and iseditableinpopup returns true then we would have executed the return statement above. assume that the value can be represented as a string.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	postgresql follows the standard for sql bit. it's a string of bits. so bit(10) is a string of 10 bits. jdbc treats sql bit as if it were only a single bit. it specifies that bit is equivalent to boolean. it claims that the preparedstatement set method that should be used with bit is setboolean and getboolean. this is not compliant with the standard. so sql bit type support is broken in java there is nothing we can do about that. best thing to do for now is try to convert the bit type to a boolean like the jdbc spec says and hope for the best. hope that the source database isn't using the bit column as a sequence of multiple bits.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jdbc spec says that bit refers to a boolean column - i.e. a single binary digit with value either "0" or "1". also the same spec encourages use of getboolean/setboolean. however the sql-92 standard clearly states that the bit type is a bit string with length >= 0. so for sql-92 compliant databases (like postgresql) the jdbc spec's support for bit is at best broken and unusable. still we do what the jdbc spec suggests as that is all that we can do.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there are some fields that cannot be used in a where clause either because there cannot be an exact match (e.g. real float) or because we may not have the actual data in hand (blob/clob) or because the data cannot be expressed in a string form (e.g. binary). an update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row (because we can only "see" the fields that we know how to do wheres on). therefore when we are updating them there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria (we hope). we determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the where clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the where clause. any field that can be used there will return something of the form "<fieldname> = <value>" and a field that cannot be used will return a null or zero-length string.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clobs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the db is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself. during the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read therefore we do not need to re-read the datum from the database because we know that we have the entire descriptor. if the contents of the clob have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to detect two empty text values in a row before we decide to restore the original value. since 'text' contains the new value we want to allow the first empty 'text' so that the user can clear the field and on the second one we will set it to the original value.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	value is a simple string representation of the data but not the same one used in the text and in-cell operations. the in-cell version may replace newline chars with "\n" while this version does not. in other respects it is the same as the in-cell version because both use the _renderer object to do the rendering.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have an appropriate data type object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the first argument is a jtable which is only used by instances of jtextfield to convert coordinates on a double-click. since that cannot happen with the jtextarea do not bother passing the table.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we should never not have an object here because we only get here when a datatype object has claimed that the column is editable. if there is no datatype for the column then the default in the iseditablexxx() methods in this class is to say that the column is not editable and therefore we should never have this method called in that case.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here then no data type object was found for this column. (should not get here because switch default returns null.)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now the popup-related methods. these are not quite symmetric with the in-cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to display in the popup is handled internally to the datatype object inside getjtextarea() so we do not need a "renderobjectinpopup" function visible to the rest of the world.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the rest of the world that the table has changed. the 'fire' method used here is very course - it says that the whole table has been changed when really only one row has been added. however finer-grained methods did not seem to cause the right effect so i'm using this one untill someone reports a problem with it. also if either of these notifications (the actual model and the sortable model) are eliminated it either throws an exception or does not update the gui. go figure. finally the 'fire' on the _acutalmodel is triggered from this method rather than from inside the myjtable code because the add() method used to add a row is also used when loading the table with lots of rows and in that case we do not want to generate events until all of the rows have been added so the 'fire' cannot happen there.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we use the attributes and flags from the cache but the parsed header from the parsed message
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create one list containing the marked items which have to be "unmarked" and another list containing the items remained to be marked
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resync search engine -> this is only needed for lucene right now
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	folders have same root folder -> for example two imap folders on the same server -----> this means we use server-side copying which -----> is much faster than using inputstreams here also used for local folders which saves some parsing work
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	documentparser parser = new documentparser() decode message body with respect to charset

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following lines add cut/copy/paste/undo/redo/selectall actions support using the columba action objects. this means that we only have a single instance of these specific actions which is shared by all menuitems and toolbar buttons.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	2 columns rows are added dynamically (no need to define them here)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	register as listener to the selectionmanger to check for selection changes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we don't use this here - actions like reply would only work on the the encrypted message
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no charset specified -> automatic mode -> try to determine charset based on content parameter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create attachment component with text icon tooltip context menu and double-click action
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	changing the selection to the specified row changeselection(row 0 true false)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for multipart content-types we need to take action (if boundary is nonexistent) eudora stores content type = multipart even though the message is not really multipart - e.g. because an attachment already has has been decoded by eudora)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	attachments found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store header after processing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no date header was found it is necessary to contruct a new one (this is the case for outgoing messages from eudora)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is html try to find out which charset from meta tag nb the seach for charset below is very simple. it assumes that the meta tag to find is on its own line i.e. " <meta" can be found at the beginning of the line and all the content of the tag is found on the same line! could be better but this is first shot
