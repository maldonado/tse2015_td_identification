WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	// some collections are not lazy:
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	// Here we don't want to suspend the tx. If we do: // 1) We might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted // changes.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	// Add a zero (or quite low) timeout option so we don't block. // Ignore any TimeoutException. Basically we forego caching the // query result in order to avoid blocking. // Reads are done with suspended tx, so they should not hold the // lock for long.
