WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	A node identifying a new path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For the text node, add a property.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the containing object was a String, then use it as the ID.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this attribute was added by this task, then we append this value to the existing value. We use the setProperty method which will forcibly override the property if it already exists. We need to put these properties into the project when we read them, though (instead of keeping them outside of the project and batch adding them at the end) to allow other properties to reference them.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Never include the "refid" attribute as part of the attribute name.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The ResourceLocation may specify a relative url for its location attribute. This is resolved using the appropriate base.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We didn't match a ResourceLocation, but since we only support PUBLIC and URI entry types internally, it is still possible that there is another entry in an external catalog that will match. We call Apache resolver's resolveEntity method to cover this possibility.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the passed in base in preference to the base from matchingEntry, which is either null or the directory in which the external catalog file from which it was obtained is located. We make a copy so matchingEntry's original base is untouched. Of course, if there is no base, no need to make a copy...

Ultimately, we should probably include a "CatalogManager.properties" file in the ant jarfile with some default property settings. See CatalogManager.java for more details.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure CatalogResolver instantiates ApacheCatalog, rather than a plain Catalog
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	debug CatalogManager.getStaticManager().setVerbosity(4);
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Pass in reference to ourselves so we can be called back.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Interestingly enough, we get to here when a user uses -Dname=value. However, in some cases, the OS goes ahead and parses this out to args {"-Dname", "value"} so instead of parsing on "=", we just make the "-D" characters go away and skip one argument forward. I don't know how to predict when the JDK is going to help or not, so we simply look for the equals sign.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Ignore - we are interested only in the side effect - that of getting the static initializers invoked. As we do not want to call a valid constructor to get this side effect, an attempt is made to call a hopefully invalid constructor - come on, nobody would have a constructor that takes in 256 String arguments ;-) (In fact, they can't - according to JVM spec section 4.10, the number of method parameters is limited to 255 by the definition of a method descriptor. Constructors count as methods here.)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use to scan own archive
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collect filesets to pass them to getResourcesToAdd
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we're in this finally clause because of an exception, we don't really care if there's an exception when closing the stream. E.g. if it throws "ZIP file must have at least one entry", because an exception happened before we added any files, then we must swallow this exception. Otherwise, the error that's reported will be the close() error, which is not the real cause of the problem.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Bad luck. There are resources in the filesets that make the archive out of date, but not in the non-fileset resources. We need to rescan the non-FileSets to grab all of them now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ZIPs store time with a granularity of 2 seconds, round up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry expects the ZipEntry to know its size and the CRC sum before you start writing the data when using STORED mode - unless it is seekable. This forces us to process the data twice.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We just set the prefix for this fileset, and pass it up.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Precedence: manifestFile wins over inline manifest, over manifests read from the filesets over the original manifest. merge with null argument is a no-op
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	filesets are separate from the rest for performance reasons. If we use the code for union below, we'll always scan all filesets, even if we know the target is out of date after the first test.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the archive is built for the first time and it is matched by a resource collection, then it hasn't been found in check (it hasn't been there) but will be included now. for some strange reason the old code would simply skip the entry and not fail, do the same now for backwards compatibility reasons. Without this, the which4j build fails in Gump
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	preserve permissions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	override permissions if set explicitly
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Check if we can contact the URL
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the Exec OS check is different from Os.isOs(), which probes for a specific OS. Instead it searches the os field for the current os.name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Similar to a fileset, but doesn't allow dir attribute to be set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the destination directory didn't already exist, or was empty, then no previous file removal is necessary!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Default the viewpath to basedir if it is not specified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	preserveInTarget would find all files we want to keep, but we need to find all that we want to delete - so the meaning of all patterns and selectors must be inverted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	On VMS platform, we need to create a special java options file containing the arguments and classpath for the java command. The special file is supported by the "-V" switch on the VMS JVM.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Do nothing if no resources (including nested text)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Windows has a 32k limit on total arg size, so create a temporary file to store all the arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	filesets has been protected so we need to keep that even after switching to resource collections. In fact, they will still get a different treatment form the other resource collections even in execute since we have some subtle special features like switching type to "dir" when we encounter a DirSet that would be more difficult to achieve otherwise.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to reset the stream handler to restart reading of pipes; go ahead and do it always w/ nested redirectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here, in and out have not been specified, we are in batch processing mode.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Ignore and keep trying
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Chunk part of previous env var (UNIX env vars can contain embedded new lines).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Since we "look ahead" before adding, there's one last env var.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	noop default encoding used
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	On OpenVMS Runtime#exec() doesn't support the environment array, so we only return the new values which then will be set in the generated DCL script, inheriting the parent process environment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Locate the auxiliary script
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Build the command
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Writes the command into a temporary DCL script and returns the corresponding File object. The script will be deleted on exit. @param cmd the command line to execute as an array of strings. @param env the environment to set as an array of strings. @return the command File. @throws IOException if errors are encountered creating the file.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected and private methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ensure that parent dir of dest file exists!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the single group arguments Javadoc 1.2 rules: Multiple -group args allowed. Each arg includes 3 strings: -group [name] [packagelist]. Elements in [packagelist] are colon-delimited. An element in [packagelist] may end with the wildcard.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for each sourcePath entry, add a directoryset with includes taken from packagenames attribute and nested package elements and excludes taken from excludepackages attribute and nested excludepackage elements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Override the logging of output in order to filter out Generating messages. Generating messages are set to a priority of VERBOSE unless they appear after what could be an informational message.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Methods below all add specific selectors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If verbosity is MSG_VERBOSE, that mean we are doing regular logging (backwards as that sounds). In that case, we want to print one message about deleting the top of the directory tree. Otherwise, the removeDir method will handle messages for _all_ directories.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hand down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create intermediary directories - sometimes zip don't add them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	SQL defines "--" as a comment to EOL and in Oracle it may contain a hint so we cannot just remove it, instead we must end it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	In Ant 1.1, <chmod dir="foo" /> means, change the permissions of directory foo, not anything inside of it. This is the case the second branch of the if statement below catches for backwards compatibility.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for historical and performance reasons we have to do things in a rather complex way. (1) Move is optimized to move directories if a fileset has been included completely, therefore FileSets need a special treatment. This is also required to support the failOnError semantice (skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collections). (2) We carry around a few protected methods that work on basedirs and arrays of names. To optimize stuff, all resources with the same basedir get collected in separate lists and then each list is handled in one go.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we create a fileset with the source file. this lets us combine our logic for handling output directories, mapping etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if input files are specified, inputString and inputStream are ignored; classes that work with redirector attributes can enforce whatever warnings are needed

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For -sourcepath, use the "sourcepath" value if present. Otherwise default to the "srcdir" value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Many system have been reported to get into trouble with long command lines - no, not only Windows ;-). POSIX seems to define a lower limit of 4k, so use a temporary file if the total length of the command line exceeds this limit.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is a bootclasspath stated. By default, the includeJavaRuntime is false. If the user has stated a bootclasspath and said to include the java runtime, it's on their head!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The following is data used while processing stdout of CVS command

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Directory where "source" EJB files are stored and where stubs and skeletons will also be written.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This Hashtable maintains a list of EJB class files processed by the ejbc utility (both "source" class files as well as stubs and skeletons). The key for the Hashtable is a String representing the path to the class file (relative to the destination directory). The value for the Hashtable is a File object which reference the actual class file.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Execute the ejbc utility -- stubs/skeletons are rebuilt, if needed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	EJB's display name EJB's home interface name EJB's remote interface name EJB's implementation class EJB's primary key class or "stateful" or "stateless" Does this EJB support CMP? Does this EJB support IIOP? Does this EJB require failover? CMP descriptor list
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Check the timestamp on the EJB implementation class. Note that if ONLY the implementation class has changed, it's not necessary to rebuild the EJB stubs and skeletons. For this reason, we ensure the file exists (using lastModified above), but we DON'T compare it's timestamp with the timestamps of the home and remote interfaces (because it's irrelevant in determining if ejbc must be run)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we get here, it could be because we are trying to put a directory entry that already exists. For example, we're trying to write "com", but a previous entry from another mergefile was called "com". In that case, just ignore the error and go on to the next entry.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	First, some notes. On MRJ 2.2.2, getting the size, compressed size, and CRC32 from the ZipInputStream does not work for compressed (deflated) files. Those calls return -1. For uncompressed (stored) files, those calls do work. However, using ZipFile.getEntries() works for both compressed and uncompressed files. Now, from some simple testing I did, it seems that the value of CRC-32 is independent of the compression setting. So, it should be easy to pass this information on to the output entry.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Quick return - no output do nothing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Self-describing as of JUnit 4 (#38811). But trim "(ClassName)".
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the trick to integrating test output to the formatter, is to create a special test class that asserts an error and tell the formatter that it raised.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignored.

Others mark errors as info, for example edit a file which is already open for edit..... Just look for error: - catches most things....
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Because of the way I create the full target path, there must be NO slash at the end of targetFolder and folderName However, if the slash or backslash is the only character, leave it alone

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We have the loader which is being used to load the CatalogResolver. Can it see the ApacheResolver? The base resolver will only be able to create the ApacheResolver if it can see it - doesn't use the context loader.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the passed in base in preference to the base from matchingEntry, which is either null or the directory in which the external catalog file from which it was obtained is located. We make a copy so matchingEntry's original base is untouched. This is the standard behavior as per my reading of the JAXP and XML Catalog specs. CKS 11/7/2002
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Get Method instances for each of the methods we need to call on the resolverImpl using reflection. We can't call them directly, because they require on the xml-commons resolver library which may not be available in the classpath.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We didn't match a ResourceLocation, but since we only support PUBLIC and URI entry types internally, it is still possible that there is another entry in an external catalog that will match. We call Apache resolver's resolveEntity method to cover this possibility.

A 32 bit value does not really give a strong enough guarantee that the value will not appear by chance in the compressed datastream. Worst-case probability of this event, for a 900k block, is about 2.0e-3 for 32 bits, 1.0e-5 for 40 bits and 4.0e-8 for 48 bits. For a compressed file of size 100Gb -- about 100000 blocks -- only a 48-bit marker will do. NB: normal compression/ decompression do not rely on these statistical properties.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The clean way would be to throw an exception. throw new IOException("crc error");
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make next blocks readable without error (repair feature, not yet documented, not tested)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Setting up the unzftab entries here is not strictly necessary, but it does save having to do it later in a separate pass, and so saves a block's worth of cache misses.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tt.length should always be >= length, but theoretically it can happen, if the compressor mixed small and large blocks. Normally only the last block will be smaller than others.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	deprecated, but email is byte-oriented
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE We have fit EOF, and the block is not full! This is a broken archive. It does not follow the standard blocking algorithm. However, because we are generous, and it requires little effort, we will simply ignore the error and continue as if the entire block were read. This does not appear to break anything upstream. We used to return false in this case. Thanks to 'Yohann.Roussel@alcatel.fr' for this fix.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	version needed to extract general purpose bit flag
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	requires version 2 as we are going to store length info in the data descriptor
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	file comment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	swallow, throw the original exception instead
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	compressed size
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	disk number start
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	total number of entries in
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	total number of entries in
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	$NON-NLS-1$
