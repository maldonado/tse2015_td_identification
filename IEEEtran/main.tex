\begin{abstract}
The metaphor of technical debt was introduced to express the trade off between productivity and quality, i.e., when developers take shortcuts or perform quick hacks. More recently, our work has shown that it is possible to detect technical debt using source code comments (i.e., self-admitted technical debt), and that the most common types of self-admitted technical debt are design and requirement debt. However, all approaches thus far heavily depend on the manual classification of source code comments. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically identify design and requirement self-admitted technical debt using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We study 10 open source projects: Ant, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JMeter, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL and find that 1) we are able to accurately identify self-admitted technical debt, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art based on fixed keywords and phrases; 2) words related to sloppy code or mediocre source code quality are the best indicators of design debt, whereas words related to the need to complete a partially implemented requirement in the future are the best indicators of requirement debt; and 3) we can achieve 90\% of the best classification performance, using as little as 23\% of the comments for both design and requirement \SATD, and 80\% of the best performance, using as little as 9\% and 5\% of the comments for design and requirement \SATD, respectively. The last finding shows that the proposed approach can achieve a good accuracy even with a relatively small training dataset.

%To facilitate future work we make our datasets of classified comments publicly available, which are composed of more than 62,000 manually classified comments.

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

\IEEEPARstart{D}{evelopers} often have to deal with conflicting goals that require software to be delivered quickly, with high quality, and on budget. In practice, achieving all of these goals at the same time can be challenging, causing a tradeoff to be made. Often, these tradeoffs lead developers to take \emph{shortcuts} or use \emph{workarounds}. Although such shortcuts help developers in meeting their short-term goals, they may have a negative impact in the long-term.

Technical debt is a metaphor coined to express sub-optimal solutions that are taken in a software project in order to achieve some short-term goals~\cite{Cunningham1992WPM}. Generally, these decisions allow the project to move faster in the short-term, but introduce an increased cost (i.e., debt) to maintain this software in the long run~\cite{Seaman2011,Kruchten2013IWMTD}.  Prior work has shown that technical debt is widespread in the software domain, is unavoidable, and can have a negative impact on the quality of the software~\cite{Lim2012Software}. 

\revised{Technical debt can be deliberately or inadvertently incurred~\cite{Fowler:quadrant}. Inadvertent technical debt is technical debt that is taken on unknowingly. One example of inadvertent technical debt is architectural decay or architectural drift. To date, the majority of the technical debt work has focused on inadvertent technical debt~\cite{Nord2012WICSA}. On the other hand, deliberate technical debt, is debt that is incurred by the developer with knowledge that it is being taken on. One example of such deliberate technical debt, is self-admitted technical debt, which is the focus of our paper.}{R1-1}

Due to the importance of technical debt, a number of studies empirically examined technical debt and proposed techniques to enable its detection and management. \revised{Some of the approaches analyze the source code to detect technical debt, whereas other approaches leverage various techniques and artifacts, e.g., documentation and architecture reviews, to detect documentation debt, test debt or architecture debt (i.e., unexpected deviance from the initial architecture)~\cite{Alves2016IST,Xiao2016ICSE}.}{R1-2}   

The main findings of prior work are three-fold. First, there are different types of technical debt, e.g., defect debt, design debt, testing debt, and that among them design debt has the highest impact~\cite{Alves2014MTD,Marinescu2012IBM}. Second, static source code analysis helps in detecting technical debt, (i.e., code smells)~\cite{Marinescu2004ICSM,Marinescu2010CSMR,Zazworka2013CSE}. Third, more recently, our work has shown that it is possible to identify technical debt through source comments, referred to as  \SATD~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}, and that design and requirement debt are the most common types of \SATD~\cite{Maldonado2015MTD}.

\revised{
The recovery of technical debt through source code comments has two main advantages over traditional approaches based on source code analysis. First, it is more lightweight compared to source code analysis, since it does not require the construction of Abstract Syntax Trees or other more advanced source code representations. For instance, some code smell detectors that also provide refactoring recommendations to resolve the detected code smells~\cite{Tsantalis:2011, Tsantalis:2015} generate computationally expensive program representation structures, such as program dependence graphs~\cite{Graf:2010}, and method call graphs~\cite{Ali:2012} in order to match structural code smell patterns and compute metrics. On the other hand, the source code comments can be easily and efficiently extracted from source code files using regular expressions. Second, it does not depend on arbitrary metric threshold values, which are required in all metric-based code smell detection approaches. Deriving appropriate threshold values is a challenging open problem that has attracted the attention and effort of several researchers~\cite{Oliveira2014CSMR,Fontana2015WETSoM,Fontana2015EMSE}. As a matter of fact, the approaches based on source code analysis suffer from high false positive rates~\cite{Fontana:2016} (i.e., they flag a large number of source code elements as problematic, while they are not perceived as such by the developers), because they rely only on the structure of the source code to detect code smells without taking into account the developers' feedback, the project domain, and the context in which the code smells are detected.

However, relying solely on the developers' comments to recover technical debt is not adequate, because developers might be unaware of the presence of some code smells in their project, or might not be very familiar with good design and coding practices (i.e., inadvertent debt).
As a result, the detection of technical debt through source code comments can be only used as a complementary approach to existing code smell detectors based on source code analysis.
We believe that \SATD can be useful to prioritize the \textit{pay back} of debt (i.e., develop a \textit{pay back} plan), since the technical debt expressed in the comments written by the developers themselves might be more relevant to them.
As a matter of fact, in a recent survey~\cite{Vassallo:ICSME:2016} with 152 developers of a large financial organization (ING Netherlands), 88\% of the participants responded that they annotate poor implementation choices (i.e., design technical debt) with comments in the source code (i.e., \SATD), 
and when time allows, they act on them by trying to refactor such smells using some automated tool support (71\%), or manually (29\%).
}{R1-3}


Despite the advantages of recovering technical debt from source code comments, the research in \SATD, thus far, heavily relies on the manual inspection of code comments. The current-state-of-the art approach~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME} uses 62 comment patterns (i.e., words and phrases) derived after the manual examination of more than 100K comments. The manual inspection of code comments is subject to reader bias, time consuming and, as any other manual task, susceptible to errors. These limitations in the identification of \SATD comments makes the current state-of-the-art approach difficult to be applied in practice.

Therefore, in this paper we investigate the efficiency of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically detect the two most common types of \SATD, i.e., design and requirement debt. We analyze ten open source projects from different application domains, namely, Ant, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JMeter, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL. We extract and classify the source comments of these projects. Then, using the classified dataset we train a \revised{maximum entropy classifier using the Stanford Classifier tool}{R2-11}~\cite{manning2003optimization} to identify design and requirement \SATD.
The advantages of the \revised{maximum entropy classifier}{R2-11} over keyword-based and pattern-based approaches, such as comment patterns, are twofold. First, the \revised{maximum entropy classifier}{R2-11} automatically extracts the most important features (i.e., words) for each class (i.e., design \SATD, requirement \SATD, and without technical debt) based on a classified training dataset given as input. Second, the \revised{maximum entropy classifier}{R2-11}, apart from finding features that contribute positively to the classification of a comment in a given class, also finds features that contribute negatively to the classification of a comment in a given class.

We perform a leave-one-out cross-project validation (i.e., we train on nine projects and test on one project). Our results show that we are able to  achieve an average F1-measure of 0.620 when identifying design \SATD, and an average F1-measure of 0.403 when identifying requirement \SATD. We compare the performance of our approach to a simple (random) baseline and the state-of-the-art approach used to detect \SATD~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}. Our results show that on average, we outperform the state-of-the-art by\revised{2.3 times, when detecting design debt, and by 6 times when detecting requirement debt.}{R1-8}

To better understand how developers express technical debt we analyze the 10 most prevalent words appearing within \SATD comments. 
We find that the top design debt words are related to sloppy or mediocre source code. For example, words such as `hack', `workaround' and `yuck!' are used to express design \SATD. On the other hand, for requirement debt, words indicating the need to complete a partially implemented requirement are the best indicators. For example, words such as `todo', `needed' and `implementation' are strong indicators of requirement debt. 

Finally, to determine the most efficient way to apply our approach, we analyze the amount of training data necessary to effectively identify \SATD. We find that training datasets using 23\% of the available data can achieve a performance equivalent to 90\% of the maximum F1-measure score for both design and requirement \SATD. Similarly, 80\% of the maximum F1-measure can be achieved using only 9\% of the available data for design \SATD, and 5\% for requirement \SATD.

The main contributions of our work are the following:
\vspace{-1.5mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We provide an automatic, NLP-based, approach to identify design and requirement \SATD.
  \item We examine and report the words that best indicate design and requirement \SATD.
  \item We show that using a small training set of comments, we are able to effectively detect design and requirement \SATD.
  \item We make our dataset publicly available, so that others can advance work in the area of \SATD~\cite{rep_package}.
\end{itemize}
